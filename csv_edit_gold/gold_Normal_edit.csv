Covid protocol has kept me from making a move though.,"[supporter] I understand that. I think you have a legitimate complaint.

Well I was put in contact with a recruiter who listed the job. Started as a contract and went direct after a year.,[supporter] Wow that sounds super interesting. You have nothing to lose going to upper management though with your concern. I have been in management and when employees came to me with concerns and showed me how much they cared about their job to take the time to bring me their input.,[seeker] I've been looking but the market is flooded. I might just retire earlier than anticipated.  take on some freelance to supplement my income.

Boeing is an amazing company.,[seeker] I'd do it. I think they have a hiring freeze on at the moment.  Gulfstram in Georgia is close to me. They have been hiring contractors like gang busters.

Last week I was transferred to a new team and all of the hard work I had put in for 6 months was given to another engineer to finish.

"[supporter] my hair is driving me crazy, so I get your frustration",[supporter] Is it long enough to braid?,[seeker] I went a year without cutting mine as well for the same reason. That is probably why it felt so out of control now that you say that. Now that I am vaccinated I just got it cut. Maybe I will like it better now.,"[seeker] Yes, I do like braids. That is a good idea.",[supporter] yay!  a haircut!!!  Congrats,[seeker] Thank you. It does make it feel a little better.,[seeker] I hope you can get yours cut soon too.,[supporter] one last suggestion: ask more stylists' opinions perhaps?,[supporter] oh thankyou....had my shot yesterday....now I have to wait for our lockdown to expire (May 20) so I have a bit more shag to go,"[seeker] Yes, good idea. It seems it has been so long to be able to do this. Maybe I need to think of a new style.",[seeker] Had my second shot last Thursday so I hope opportunities like a new stylist happen soon.,[supporter] Have you googled images for short curly hairstyles?,[seeker] I will look on Pinterest. Good idea.,[supporter] Second shot congrats!!   Very exciting.,[supporter] Pinterest is a great source for hairstyles as I recall...there are boards and boards of them.

[supporter] Hello how are you?,"[seeker] I'm, okay, thanks, and you?  I'm feeling a bit down because I'm alone for the holidays.","[supporter] Well that's no good, does your family live far away?","[seeker] Yes, my family is scattered all over the country, like Seattle, Georgia, PA.  I'm sure I'm not the only one with no plans this weekend, though.","[supporter] True but I can understand that, it is hard being alone at the holidays.",[supporter] Did you have plans this weekend?,[seeker] No.  My nearby friends all went away for the holidays.  I could probably just occupy my time with things I need or want to do in order to distract myself.,[supporter] What kind of hobbies do you have?,[seeker] I'm teaching myself the piano.  I'm also teaching myself  how to work a stenography machine for possible future employment as a stenographer.  I also like to read novels.,[supporter] I have never understood how those work..I find it amazing someone can type out whole words or sentences with one word,"[seeker] Yeah, it's pretty cool.  For example, if I hit DRAT in one stroke, then ""Did there come a time"" will appear in English on my machine's  LCD screen.","[supporter] Wow that is crazy, I don't understand how that works, is it preprogrammed or does it go by how the word sounds?","[seeker] Each stenographer has their own ""Personal Dictionary"" which is a list of words in English along with how you in particular write out those words or phrases in steno.  This dictionary is present within the actual steno machine after you transfer it from your laptop to the machine via cable or wifi.  Thus your machine then knows how you write out words in particular and how to translate those words from steno to English - each stenographer writes a little differently.","[supporter] OK that makes sense, so you basically program it as the user. I take it your stenography machine becomes pretty close to you lol",[supporter] Is this your first holiday alone?,,,,,,13,Normal,"Not having enough friends nearby. My three nearby friends went away for holidays, so I have no one to spend time with over this weekend.",The house is too quiet.

[seeker] finals are this week and i'm freaking out!,[seeker] hello,[supporter] That must be so stressful!! Have you started studying?,"[seeker] Yes, I've been studying for weeks now.  But some of my professors give the oddest quizzes that seem to not match anything we've worked on! (2)","[supporter] I remember when i was in school, finals were always so stressful. I used to make sure that i took breaks, it really helped me keep my head on straight.","[seeker] yeah, I can do that at times.  But I also work part-time while I'm in school.  I guess I should have planned ahead and taken this week off. (3)","[supporter] You can even find time to relax without taking a lot of time off, do you have any exercise you like doing?",[seeker] not really.  I had Covid last month and my dr told me not to do anything more than walking for 3 months while my lungs and body recover.  So that's hard (4),"[supporter] Oh wow, i'm so sorry to hear that! How are you feeling now?",[seeker] I'm ok.  But extremely tired.  The dr said the fatigue could take months to go away.  So it's a struggle with work and school. (5),"[supporter] Have you tried meditating or mindfulness? When i broke my leg and couldn't exercise, it really helped me relax.",[supporter] I'm sure! I'm very impressed that you are still wroking and in school despite being sick. You should feel proud of yourself,[seeker] I have not.  I pray a lot and that does help.  Honestly it's the only relief I've gotten lately.  I have three more finals and a paper due by Friday.,"[supporter] Praying is helpful! Mindfulness goes very hand in hand with it, if you look online, there are tons of free midnfulness classes and guides. I think it could really help you especially before a test.",[seeker] I will look into it.  I had to go back to work before I was ready because I was out for 3 weeks with Covid.  And school is mostly all online so at least I don't have to go in (7),[supporter] That's really hard but i'm happy that you can stay home at least.
