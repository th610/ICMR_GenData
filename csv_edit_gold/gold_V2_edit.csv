Perhaps a family member may help?,[seeker] i haven't told the specifics of this mess to my parents; i dont want to burden them with this.  they worry about me enough as it is.  my sisters wouldn't be able to help me.  they both have seirous emotional issues and are both in very bad marriages and have plenty of their own problems.,"[supporter] Just from chatting with you, I can see why you are anxious.
