When there’s uncertainty around job security, it’s not just about work; it can touch finances, stability, even your sense of control.

You mentioned that not having a reliable source is what’s eating at you. That makes a lot of sense — uncertainty often feels heavier than bad news itself.

What do you want out of the relationships?,[seeker] Something normal! Im fine with being single too. It comes with a lot less drama.,[supporter] It sounds like the relationships give you a lot of drama.  What do you crave in a relationship?,[seeker] companionship and nonconditional support. committment and that is hard to find out here these days. a lot of guys want the physical without the commitment. I'm getting too old for those games,"[supporter] I understand where you are coming from.  I've seen a lot of men in relationships not be so committed for real, but just like the physical part.",[seeker] yep. like my aunt said why pay for the milk when you can get the cow for free. i've done that for years and im getting tired of it. not to mention my libido is slowing down so i see things clearer,"[supporter] Just from chatting with you, I see that you feel like you want more from the relationship and would like commitment on more than one level.",,,,,,,,615,V1,"I broke up with a guy. I still talk to him. He might want me back-not sure. There is another guy who is interested in me now, However he's going through a divorce and keeps putting off seeing me.","Someone mentioned my ex could be seeing someone else, and it instantly made all the mixed signals feel more confusing.","What do you want most from your ex right now, clarity, closure, or space to move on?",Nothing is confirmed. It just adds noise to a situation that already feels messy.,"With so much uncertainty, it might help to slow things down and check in with what feels healthiest for you right now. Rather than reacting to rumors, what would make you feel more secure and respected in your relationships?",TRUE,1
[seeker] how are you today,"[supporter] Hello , what is it that is bothering you?",[seeker] i haven't been feeling too good recently. i have just been generally depressed,[seeker] i am a bit worried,[supporter] So you have been just generally feeling down and worried about everything?,[seeker] i am worried a bit about loosing my job,[supporter] I understand why that can have you worried. Have you been told this is a possibility?,[seeker] no but i just don't get a good vib,[seeker] vibe,[supporter] Have you talked to co workers or others about this?,[seeker] my coworkers are almost always unavaible. and be cause we are all working remotely they just dont' answer ims,[supporter] This is a worry that many others are having right now. Maybe there is an online group that deals in this type of worry.,[seeker] that's a good idea! you mean within my company though?,"[supporter] If your company has that, otherwise there are online chat groups that would.",,,,,,,275,V1,i keep feeling as though i'm not doing well. i have a job but i don't seem to be very good at it and i don't want to lose it. i am fearful that i will,"I heard a coworker mention downsizing on our team, and it spiked my fear because I already feel shaky about my performance.","When you think you are not doing well, what is the evidence you point to, mistakes, feedback, or just a feeling?","The comment was vague. No timeline, no names, no official message, just enough to trigger panic.",It sounds like the rumor hit an already vulnerable spot for you. Maybe we can separate what’s confirmed from what’s assumed and then look at one small action that would help you feel steadier in your role this week.,TRUE,1
"[seeker] Very true, thank you for the perspective","[supporter] So, what sort of clothes do you think you are going to buy? :)",[seeker] Possibly a new dress or two,[supporter] Sounds like a great idea. I bought a fantastic maxi dress recently. Very flattering for those of us carrying an extra pound or two,[seeker] I love flowy dresses for that reason,[seeker] do you do anything else when you are feeling bad about yourself?,"[supporter] I like a nice facemask and a bubble bath, do you?","[seeker] I like doing my makeup and getting dressed up, even if I have nowhere to go",[supporter] That is a good thing to do .. great for the self esteem. Maybe buy some new jewellery too?,[seeker] I like the idea of pampering myself. That is something I don't do too often,[seeker] and I need to do it more. Perhaps I will feel better then,[supporter] You need to indulge yourself from time to time :) Get yourself a nice bottle of wine too. Though maybe not chocolate :D,"[seeker] Haha, yes, perhaps not those :)",[supporter] Anyway I hope you are feeling a little better now ! Thank you for talking!,,,,,,,1028,V1,"I hate looking at myself in the mirror, every time I do I feel like the ugliest person in the whole world. I feel like nobody will ever love me.","I overheard him talking about spending time with someone else, and my brain instantly turned it into a story that I am not enough.","When you have the thought nobody will ever love me, what do you usually do next, isolate, seek reassurance, or criticize yourself?",I do not know what he meant. It was a few words and now I am stuck comparing myself to an imaginary person.,"It’s understandable that your mind connected those few words to your deeper insecurities. Instead of trying to decode what he meant right now, can we pause and look at how harshly you’re speaking to yourself and what a more balanced thought might sound like?",TRUE,1
"[seeker] That's very good to hear. I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, I just don't feel comfortable approaching her. I had this feeling she is doing it on purpose, I just don't understand why.","[supporter] I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.","[supporter] I know this seems hard, but I believe that you can do it!","[seeker] I will give it a try, but it's very hard for me to swallow the way she has treated me.","[supporter] People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are ENOUGH! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this.","[seeker] Thanks for understanding, I feel better now.   I will give it sometime and if I don't feel like it or don't hear from her any more, I will take it that it's time to move on.",[supporter] I think that is a good approach. You will get through this!,[seeker] You have been a big help and I can't thank you enough,[supporter] Anytime. I hope your feeling even a little better. Is there anything else I can help you with today?,"[seeker] No, you've helped enough already and I thank you once again for your support",[seeker] I wish I had chatted with  you sooner,"[supporter] Glad to be of service to you. If there is nothing else, feel free to click quit whenever your ready.","[supporter] Aww, I am so glad that I was of help to you.","[seeker] okay, no problem . Nice chatting with you",[seeker] Take care and bye,[supporter] Take care! Bye,,,,,238,V1,"I have a very good friend whom I have noticed does not tell me the truth , she cherry picks what she wants to tell me. I have also noticed that she doesn't call me unless I call. What got me so upset what was she did the last time I called her. She got me off the phone in a matter of seconds saying that she will call back , but never did. I felt so dejected and promised never to call her back again.","A mutual friend hinted she has been saying things about me to others, and it made me feel exposed and foolish for trusting her.","What is the most painful part for you, the possibility of gossip, the pattern of her not calling back, or the feeling of being dismissed?","I have no proof. It is just a report from someone else, and now I am running through every past conversation.","I can hear how hurt and exposed this makes you feel. Before making a final decision about the friendship, it might help to clarify what you actually know versus what you’ve heard and then think about what kind of conversation or boundary would feel respectful to you.",TRUE,1
