[supporter] Hello.  How can I help you today?,[seeker] Hi. I am feeling really depressed.,[supporter] Is there anything particular that you are feeling depressed about?,[seeker] Well I recently lost my grandfather and since then I have been feeling I am not doing well in life and that it's pointless.,[supporter] Losing a family member can be very tough.  It seems like you are having a hard time going forward.,[seeker] Yes I am. I,[supporter] Do you have anyone around you that you feel comfortable talking to about this?,[seeker] I have talked to my family and my husband. They have helped some. I just feel depressed because I feel like I a not making an impact with my life.,[supporter] It's great you have family in your life that you can talk to.  It sounds like having a strong family is something you can be proud of.,[seeker] Yes. That is true.,[seeker] I think the idea that I could also lose the at some point is very hard to deal with.,[supporter] I agree.  I also worry about losing my family,[seeker] What do you do to help feel better?,"[supporter] From my experience, I just focus on the now and try not to worry about things that may be out of my control.",[supporter] Have you ever tried meditation?,[seeker] No i have not. I am kind of a wired person and think I would struggle to meditate.,"[supporter] I understand.  That may be exactly what could help you, though. It may be good to Try something that may open yourself up to new experiences.",,,,1124,V5,I am depressed as I feel I am not good enough or doing enough in life.,"I keep feeling behind no matter what I do, and it is like my brain collects evidence that I am failing.",That constant self comparison sounds draining and it can make even small days feel heavy.,Sometimes I catch myself wishing I could just not wake up and everything would pause.,I hear how worn down you are. What has been piling up the most lately.,TRUE
[supporter] Did you guys break up recently?,"[seeker] yes she broke my heart last night, what did I do wrong?","[supporter] Love is tricky, sometimes there is no wrong.  You shouldn't blame yourself.",[seeker] but I gave her my all. I feel so betrayed. I'm feeling so sad I want to jump over a bridge,"[supporter] I've been there, a few years before I was married, my boyfriend broke up with me.  We had some space, and then were able to become friends again.  And you know what?  We ended up getting back together and getting married.","[seeker] you think it's my fault? 5 years man, 5 years and just like that she broke my heart","[supporter] Don't give up, you never know what the future holds.","[supporter] I don't know your particular situation, but it takes two to make relationships work.  I don't think you should blame yourself.","[seeker] thank you, will try to keep my head up. you think she cheated on me?",[supporter] I don't know what happened.  Is that what you think happened?,[seeker] well I don't know. why end so abruptly,[supporter] What did she say when you broke up?,[seeker] she just said it's over! over the damn phone,[supporter] Yikes!  I'm sure that didn't feel very good.,"[seeker] not at all, so heart broken",[supporter] Have you tried talking to her since?,"[supporter] Oftentimes people have confused feelings and after some time to reflect, things might change.",,,,865,V5,girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me,"The quiet at home feels loud, and I keep reaching for routines that no longer exist.","A breakup after years can make the world feel unfamiliar, like the ground shifted overnight.",Lately I have had thoughts about disappearing because the hurt feels too big.,It sounds like you are grieving a huge loss. What moment in the day hits you the hardest.,TRUE
[supporter] I would certainly agree with you. That kind of work is unsustainable. Let me ask you this. What would happen if you told your employer you simply could not do these hours?,"[seeker] hah - i dunno. im on a team of 2 people - and i guess if i dont do it, the other person has to. or it just doesnt get done, and i dont know what happens?? nothing? LOL.","[supporter] The worst that could happen is that they fire you. But that doesn't seem too likely as they seem to need you. But I have learned in life that if I don't care for myself, hardly anyone does. We need to be kind to ourselves. Set boundaries.","[seeker] agreed - i dont think they would fire me, maybe get reprimanded or more likely a guilt trip as to why I cant do it. Im just not sure what kind of boundaries I set when we have things due, and just literally no time.","[supporter] Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no.","[seeker] Well, I have to set boundaries, because working till 11pm most nights is not sustainable. and who on earth is going to view, let alone sign a contract at 12am","[supporter] I think that would be the first step. Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries. It is obviously destroying your life. It really isn't healthy for you.","[supporter] Exactly. It isn't working for you. Something has to change. And you sound intelligent, so you can determine what will work for you -- perhaps a range of hours, but definitely not 14 hours. Unless you are a young kid. lol Even then, that's a lot.","[seeker] yeah - ill come up with reasonable boundaries till 5:30 is reasonable, and if its a do or die situation cap it at 7:30 --- and thats only for dire situations. if that doesnt work, well then i guess either i dont have a job, or people figure out how to work in regular hours.","[supporter] That sounds reasonable to me. And if they try to make you feel guilty, reject that. Tell them, I'm sorry, but I feel this is reasonable, and truly it is.","[seeker] hah i used to go out like a young kid, but still - just because most of us are working from home 24/7, doesnt mean I actually can work 24/7. even fi i were young, hell no. they dont pay me enough.","[seeker] thanks i really appreciate it. it sounds reasonable, and its what a coworker told me. if i dont set boundaries, i will crack.",[supporter] No one can work 24/7.  I think they may not even be aware you are struggling. So communication is important.,[supporter] You don't want to crack. It's not worth it.,"[seeker] yeah, i think a call to not just my boss is in order, but also HR to advise them of the situation. they need to start telling managers, we are NOT front of the line workers, nor police, fire, etc. our jobs are not THAT important.","[supporter] I will say a prayer that you communicate your needs politely but firmly. And not believe false guilt. As you said, you aren't putting out fires and doing CPR.",,,,,224,V5,"Had to work till 11pm and up early the next morning. No emotional support and completely drained of all energy. Have no desire to continue with the job, but need to get paid.","I am running on caffeine and worry, and my body feels like it is blinking red all day.",Being pushed past your limits like that can make everything feel unbearable and narrow.,Recently I have been thinking it might be easier if I was not here to deal with this.,That makes sense given how depleted you are. What part of the schedule feels most impossible right now.,TRUE
"[seeker] Yes.  I tried to see if she would let me sleep with other women from the Internet, and she is not allowing it.",[supporter] Well I must say that as a woman I would not allow it either ;),[seeker] Yes I would agree with that.  I guess I wanted my cake and be able to eat it too.,[supporter] It does sound like it. Are there any other problems in your marriage that might be making you unhappy or is it generally okay and you just want someone else too?,"[seeker] I am trying to get my wife to spice up our love-making and she is unwilling to do so, and that makes me super sad.",[supporter] Have you considered getting some sort of marriage guidance counselling? There are people out there who might be able to help you both,"[seeker] Why would we need counseling to spice up a love life?  That should come naturally, is it hard for women to make that change?",[supporter] I think it sounds as though you might be pushing her into things she is not ready for though. Have you considered that you might be the problem?,"[seeker] That is what makes me sad, I know I am the problem.  I am a piece of trash, she is way better than me.    I hate myself.","[supporter] No, I do not think you should say that! At least you recognise that you are not behaving well, which is the first step on the road to making things better.",[seeker] Maybe I have a sex addiction.  I think I watch too much pornography and it gives me weird ideas for sex.,[supporter] Perhaps you could consider individual counselling to overcome your own problems before you think of couples' therapy?,,,,,,,,,90,V5,I wanted to start having sex with other women from the Internet and my wife would not allow it.,"This conflict makes me feel rejected and guilty at the same time, and it is turning into resentment.","Feeling shut down in a relationship can stir shame and anger, even if you did not expect it.",When I get low I think about just being gone so I would not have to face any of it.,You have a lot of tangled feelings here. What do you most want her to understand about your experience.,TRUE
"[seeker] am not feeling so good, being depressed feeling like killing myself, i don't know after all have done for her",[supporter] OK. This is a temporary feeling and it will pass. Please be kind to yourself.,[supporter] What led to you feeling this way?,"[seeker] i proposed to my girl after 5 years of dating, she introduced me to one man claiming its her uncle, was very happy i had to meet one of my fiancé family not knowing all was but lies","[seeker] she took me to go see the man, the man even gave us relationship advice","[supporter] OK. So you proposed to your girlfriend, but she was seeing another man?",[seeker] yes!! seeing the so called man she called her uncle,[supporter] And the man you thought was her uncle was her other boyfriend?,[supporter] That is a horrible situation. It's not nice when people lie to you - I've had it happen to me before.,[supporter] You must be feeling very betrayed at the moment.,"[seeker] caught them in the act, was devastated, my body was shaking, couldn't bear my eyes",[seeker] its was as if my heart was being ripped outta my soul,[supporter] That sounds horrible. I think anyone would be upset with that!,"[supporter] I wonder if it was best that this happened before you got married, though - it hurts, but it would have hurt more if she had become your wife. How does it feel if you think about it that way?",[seeker] All i could do at that moment is pretend i didn't see a thing,[seeker] yh! am happy i knew sooner,[supporter] How does your family and friends feel about it? Have you spoken to them?,"[seeker] but it s painful, i rented an apartment for her, was the one sponsoring her and her brother",[supporter] You must feel as though she has taken advantage of you and your generosity.,,394,V5,My caught my girlfriend cheating with a man of 50 years of age,"I replay the scene without meaning to, and I feel sick with embarrassment and rage.",That kind of betrayal can trap your mind in loops and make everything feel unstable.,At times I feel like I do not want to exist because the humiliation is constant in my head.,Thanks for sharing that. What detail is the one your mind returns to again and again.,TRUE
"[seeker] I need help with my anger. I am upset that the Presidential election is being stolen from President Trump. I say racist things about it, and punch myself in the head or bang my head into the wall when people disagree with me.",[supporter] Where does your anger stem from ?,[seeker] I think it is because people disagree with my politics.,[seeker] I am sick of being discriminated against because of my skin color.,[supporter] Its ok to disagree with people about topics but you need to figure out why it triggers so much anger which turns to hate,"[seeker] Half my family is Puerto Rican, I am White. All the Puerto Rican family members consider themselves to be allies of the blacks, I do not. I have been repeatedly victimized by black people,",[supporter] How have you been victimized by black people? When those events happen how did that make you feel,"[seeker] I have been robbed at gunpoint three times in the past 8 months while walking home from work. Each time, it was one or more black males with guns who robbed me. They would call me racial slurs every time too.","[seeker] Also, my wife was raped by a black homeless man in July 2020 while she was jogging in the park. This made me get so angry, that I burned down a low-income housing building that was occupied by only black residents. I tried to get even with the blacks for what happened to my wife.","[seeker] I can't seek help with a professional for my anger issues, because I have committed violent crimes to get even with my oppressors.",[seeker] Are you going to help me?,[supporter] I see I too have had my issues with other races. A few bad instances do not make represent a whole race though. There are also black males who have been robbed and jumped by white people that does not mean all white males are bad. It does seem that you have had alot of unfortunate events with black males. That still does not mean that all black people are bad and why should innocent people pay for things others have done. Do  you have to walk home from work or can you drive. Also have you reported any of these events to the police.,"[seeker] I walk home because my job is only a mile away. I live in a predominantly black area. The police have taken reports, but candidly admitted to me that nothing would happen as far as arrests because of the current ""woke"" climate.",[supporter] I understand have you ever thought about if that black man that raped your wife was just getting even with the white race because his wife or maybe even him was raped repeatedly by white supremists,,,,,,,267,V5,"I am depressed and always angry. I lose my temper and say racist things to people, and am miserable to be around. I got mad at my father inlaw for talking badly about President Trump on Thanksgiving, and I called everyone ""a bunch of nigger lovers"" and stormed out of the house. Been angry ever since.","I keep thinking about what I said and I feel disgusted with myself, then the anger flares again anyway.",That cycle of anger and shame can feel like you are trapped inside reactions you do not want.,Yesterday I found myself thinking people might be better off if I simply was not around.,I get how unsettling that is to notice in yourself. What usually happens right before you blow up.,TRUE
[supporter] I'm doing well how can I help you tonight?,"[seeker] So, the issue I'm having is work-related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He's also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask...but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6-foot boundary. A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills.",[seeker] My son just turned 2.,[supporter] I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?,[seeker] I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request.,"[seeker] In my shoes, what would you do?",[seeker] Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol,[supporter] I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don't honor your requests?,[seeker] It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I don t,[seeker] *don't get the same courtesy,[seeker] I feel frustrated because I'm REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction.,"[seeker] I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work.....my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me.",[seeker] And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too.,[supporter] I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?,[seeker] I've spoken to my boss. He was sympathetic about it all....At this point I'm not sure what to do.,[supporter] Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family?,"[seeker] Those are fairly decent ideas. The struggle for money would still be an issue if I worked part-time. And I doubt I could find a better job at this particular time. With that being said, I didn't think to see if the boss would let me work in the office for a bit. I know my fellow employees would respect my wishes.",[seeker] Any other suggestions?,[supporter] We are going through some really tough times right now and I think that most people are very sympathetic. Especially for those who are in your shoes. Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little?,[supporter] Do you get paid vacation time in your job?,187,V5,My son had heart surgery this year and is in the midst of being diagnosed with CP.

This came at the worst time.,[seeker] I don't know what to do.,[supporter] I think that selling your old possessions is a great idea,[supporter] I can tell you are stressed just by speaking to you,"[seeker] I wouldn't say they're old. One was a Christmas gift from a few months ago, but I've got to do something.","[supporter] Yes, pulling through this is the most important, because there may be a better future waiting ahead of you",[seeker] So much is closed here due to the pandemic I'm not sure who is hiring. This is just too much.,[seeker] I sure hope so. Right now I just can't see a way out.,"[supporter] It will work out somehow, I was made redundant a few months ago actually",[seeker] I'm so sorry.

Do you have any family members who might help?","[seeker] Yes, I could call my mother. She has a room to stay in. But I only have the money to drive to her home, not the money for a rental truck to move all my stuff.",[supporter] Would any family members be prepared to loan you money or a vehicle?,"[seeker] I could ask my aunt to use her car, she has an SUV, where as I drive a sedan.",[supporter] How much stuff do you have that needs to be moved?,"[seeker] Queen bed, bed frame, small desk, roll chair, bookshelf, rug, boxes of kitchen stuff, etc.",[supporter] Try not to worry too much - I was in this position once myself and it did all turn out for the best though it was very scary at the time.,"[seeker] Yes, I feel almost numb from the depression. Like non of my stuff matters, only that I am physically safe.",[supporter] I think it would be a good idea for you to try and get medical help for your depression.,"[seeker] Yes, I agree.

My family kicked me out of their own house 3 years ago. I am nothing but a burden for them. They would just appreciate if I died.,"[supporter] What about close friends, or people you care about? I am sure they would not want to lose you.",[seeker] I have NO ONE that cares about me. Not a single being.,[seeker] Are overdoses painful?,[supporter] I care,[seeker] I doubt you do. You are just getting paid to be here.,"[supporter] Just from chatting with you, I can feel how sad you are about life and maybe a little overwhelmed with what the next step of life is.",[seeker] What would be that next step if I asked you?,"[supporter] I used to be really sad about life too. However, helping others who are sad helped me become happier, knowing that I am helping others also become happier.",[seeker] What makes you think someone as useless as me could provide any help?,"[supporter] Take a deep breathe and think about any happy memories. If you are sad right now, the only way is up from here!",[supporter] I believe no one is useless. We were all brought on this earth for a reason.,[seeker] That's a very optimistic view...,"[supporter] Like I said, I used to be sad too and not optimistic. But now I am optimistic because I know what it is like to be sad, and I don't want others to feel how I have felt in the past.",[seeker] I guess that's a way to view it...,"[supporter] Have you tried to express your feelings in one way or another?

When was the last time you all connected?,[seeker] We went out for coffee the other day and I thought about saying something cos I know they went to a club without me last weekend but I couldn't bring myself to in the end.,"[supporter] I understand it is tough to bring up what is bothering you, especially after getting to hang out with all your friend over coffee. I'm sure this was not intentional with not inviting you to the club.","[seeker] Sometimes in the past I have turned down invitations to go out clubbing, admittedly. Could it be that they just did not think that I wanted to go?","[supporter] From what I have experienced personally, I am not a fan of clubs and didnt want to go with my friends. After turning them down a few times, they stopped inviting as well. I think they thought that was not my thing.",[seeker] The thing is though that this is not the only thing - they have been to rock concerts without me too. I just feel I am no longer a part of the group.,[supporter] I feel how this is hurting you. The best thing would be to talk to them about feeling disinvited to group activities.

I don't want to come across as just being paranoid or whiny. Sometimes I think it would be better to just forget them and not have any friends.,"[supporter] It sounds like this situation is really bothering you. Its hard and overwhelming to feel isolated.

Some people don't find a partner until their 40's or even 50's. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn't move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well.",[seeker] I disagree with you regarding that maybe that is what she wants me to do. I don't think she cares about me at the slightest anymore. I was a burden for her and will probably keep being it for any woman I meet.,[supporter] Did she give you any reasons to why she wasn't in love anymore?,[seeker] I think she wasn't feeling physically attracted to me anymore.,[supporter] Did you ever think she maybe possibly has been cheating?,,,,,237,V5,I fear that I might never be loved again. I feel so lonely.,"I keep imagining years passing with nobody choosing me, and it makes me feel sick with loneliness.","That fear can make the future feel bleak, especially when you are already hurting.",Sometimes I think about ending it because I do not believe I will be wanted again.,I hear how painful that belief is. When does the loneliness feel sharpest.,TRUE
"[supporter] That is a long time to think about something, so you have given it a lot of time and thought. Have you mentioned it to your partner?",[seeker] i tried to do it around 8 months ago but my partner convinced herself that it was because i was cheating on her. Her own insecurities put me under a lot of pressure to stay in the relationship to prove i wasn't  having an affair,[supporter] Sharing your feelings is important so thank you for making the effort today. It is not fair to prove a negative and that can be taxing. It sounds like you are a very patient person.,"[seeker] I try to be patient, but i feel like i am wasting my life when i could be happy on my own or potentially with someone else in the future",[seeker] Im anxious about my daughter and my relationship with her if we split up,[supporter] You have spent a great deal of time trying to make things right with your partner and you have used a great deal of effort to make it work. You are also a very loving parent who cares greatly.,"[seeker] I know i need to be true to myself but its extremely difficult, i'm  not sure how to start the process","[supporter] Yes, you are right. My parents split up later in life and I was happy to see my dad happy. I understand that isn't everyone story though. Do you have any close family members you can talk to about this? Or close friends?","[seeker] unfortunately i pushed all my friends away for the sake of the relationship, again the insecurities meant i couldn't have my own time and space. I know my family would be supportive, but there are a lot of financial issues with divorce  which worries me",[supporter] Often times people turn to church or religion and support groups in order to connect with people from the same faith. Have you considered this avenue?,"[seeker] Ive considered support groups, im a little embarrassed tho.  I don't  think religion would be much help to me",[supporter] I understand that you feel nervous about reaching out and thank you again for doing that here today. Sometimes close friends can be a good source of support. It can be hard repairing friendships though.,[seeker] Maybe i should reach out again?,"[supporter] Yes, I would reach out to old friends who may be willing to give you insight into how they viewed things. Support groups can feel intimidating but are usually very welcoming and truly there to help people.",[seeker] i just hope my daughter is young enough to be able to adapt to her parents splitting up,[supporter] Children are resilient and want their parents happy ultimately. You are a thoughtful person. Thank you for sharing your feelings today and being open to ideas and possible ways forward.,,,,,1115,V5,I want to break up with my partner who ive been married to for 6 years with a 5 year old child,"I feel trapped between guilt and fear, and I keep imagining every outcome going wrong for my child.",It makes sense that a decision like this would feel high stakes and emotionally exhausting.,Recently I have been thinking about ending it because I cannot see a choice that does not hurt someone.,"I understand how stuck you feel. What part feels most impossible right now, the talk or what comes after.",TRUE
