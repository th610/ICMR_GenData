"[seeker] the divorce took place three years ago. i let her handle the whole thing to save money on attorneys. i was willing to do anything to end the relationship, especially forfeit the money I gave her to improve her home $30000 so she could get it refinanced because of an impending balloon loan coming due. i thought she would be grateful but she kept after my bank account while destroying my soul. i had to escape her, whatever the cost. i paid with my emotions.","[supporter] So your x is wanting more, mine is doing so to control me",[seeker] the sad part is that i was a young widower with a small child and when i remarried i considered myself a hero for caring for my dying wife and my son. all i ended up being was a sucker. she smelled a sucker and she went after my good side.,[supporter] I can understand the emotion part as mine had lawyer who that encouraged her to seek more.,[supporter] I am not wanting to be with anyone because my x is jealous and wants me alone.

I want to so much hold a hand walking, but I know she will try to stop any involvement",[seeker] forget her. ignore her. time is valuable but waiting for the air to clear helps. i tried dating again but the pool of available ladies is really a swamp. gotta get really lucky or stay clear.,"[supporter] I realize the desire to be alone, but find a female friend that wants to spend time together to keep you from feeling like you are going it alone.",[seeker] looks like i am being the supporter here but give it time. alone is much better than being sucked down into the muck.,[supporter] Make a friendd 1st then the romance may come.

Showing up supports my child, but I worry I will fall apart inside. Skipping it protects me, but I fear regret. Which choice is better?","It makes sense that family gatherings would feel loaded right now, especially after feeling misled and mistreated in the relationship. When something reminds us of what we lost or endured, the body can react before we even consciously decide how we feel — that stomach drop sounds like that kind of trigger.

I hear the tension in your choice: showing up feels like support for your child, while not going feels like protecting your emotional stability. Instead of asking which is “better,” it might help to ask which cost you’re more prepared to carry this time — the internal strain of attending, or the possible regret of staying away. What would help you feel steadier if you did decide to go?",TRUE,1
[seeker] hello,[supporter] How are you this evening?,"[seeker] Things are always crazy, and of course with the pandemic my anxiety is even more through the roof.

I have a severe auto immune disease called Ulcerative Colitis, and I am on immuno suppresant meds on top of that","[supporter] Just to clarify, you are extremely anxious about the pandemic and the affect it may have on you because of your weakened immune system.",[seeker] Well  kind of yes. I am going crazy because I've had this for 8 years now and it's forever changing. I've been hospitalized so many times its crazy. This pandemic has made things worse because stress makes it all worse,"[supporter] Just from the few messages we have exchanged, I can tell it makes you very anxious",[seeker] Its just really depressing not knowing what to expect next. Its hard to trust the good days sometimes because you can have a wonderful day and wake up really sick the next. Its very unpredictable and I think whats worse is that people really don't understand.,[supporter] Have you reached out to support groups for people with auto-immune issues? it is often helpful to speak with people who are experiencing the same issues you are.,"[seeker] Yes I am part of many on facebook, and yes it does help a lot.

Sometimes people don't realize they are not being helpful and they think they are doing good when they aren't.,[seeker] I have tried to talk to him but he seems very uninterested at times. I even tried going to counseling with him and that didn't work. It's just frustrating. He was with me when the one doctor had said just how bad it was and he didn't seem to really pay attention. He was also there when I had to have an emergancy blood transfusion and it was really hard to read him. He just doesnt say or so much,[supporter] Have you asked what his feelings are towards it? Maybe he is afraid and worried about your health and he isn't sure how to express it and sometimes it comes off as uninterested.,[seeker] Yeah whenever I try it's like pulling teeth. I know some of it is how he was brought up. I don't think his dad ever showed much emotion/,[seeker] so yes I'm sure that has something to do with it. I also feel bad a lot of the time because I have two kids. I feel like I fail them a lot,[seeker] our oldest was born before I got sick. Our youngest was a miracle baby.

I have a severe auto immune disorder and even though I've had it for 8 years you never get used to it.,"Telling my kids is the part that scares me most. They are young and I do not want them imagining the worst, but hiding it feels wrong too.",This is the kind of decision that can feel impossible because both honesty and protection matter to you.,"A choice needs to be made this week. Do I explain the surgery before it happens so they are prepared, or keep quiet until after so they do not worry for days?","Facing major surgery on top of living with a long-term autoimmune condition already sounds exhausting, and having to think about how to tell your children adds another layer of weight. It makes sense that you’re pulled between wanting to protect them from worry and wanting to be honest with them. Both instincts come from care.

Instead of thinking about it as one “right” answer, it might help to consider what information would actually help them feel secure. Young children often respond more to tone and reassurance than to medical detail. What do you think they would need most in order to feel safe — clarity ahead of time, or calm confidence closer to the surgery?",TRUE,1

Is it possible to do a zoom study group or Facetime with friends?,"[seeker] Wow, that sounds like a great idea.  That might work.",[supporter] Do you have other concerns?,"[seeker] I do worry still about the financial consequences of possible failure.

If I fail this test, I fail the course.","When sleep is disrupted like this, everything feels more urgent and it can be hard to think clearly.","The exam is soon. Should I cut shifts to study properly, or keep working and just squeeze study into smaller blocks around it?","It makes sense that everything feels heightened right now — when your sleep is disrupted and the stakes feel all-or-nothing, it’s hard for your mind to settle. Working and studying pulling against each other can make it feel like there’s no good option.

Instead of thinking about it as simply “work or study,” it might help to look at what would most improve your actual performance on the exam. Would reducing a shift meaningfully increase your focus and rest, or would the financial stress of cutting hours make it harder to concentrate?

It makes sense that you’d feel exhausted and conflicted about how to handle it — especially when speaking up could carry professional risk.
