It takes a lot of courage to express what you’re going through, and I want you to know that your feelings are valid. It sounds like you’re in a really tough spot, feeling both acknowledged and ridiculed at the same time. That can be an incredibly confusing and painful experience.\n\nFirst, please remember that your worth is not determined by how others perceive you or by your social skills. The fact that you’re aware of your strengths, like your intelligence, shows that you have valuable qualities that are unique to you. It’s okay to struggle with social interactions; many people do, and that doesn’t make you any less deserving of respect or friendship.\n\nBeing teased or made fun of is not a reflection of who you are; it speaks more about the insecurities of those who choose to put others down. You deserve kindness and understanding, just like everyone else. It’s commendable that you can laugh it off, but it’s also important", "detection": {"label": "normal", "confidence": 0.7843748927116394}}}
