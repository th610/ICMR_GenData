Actually, I have told the pastor I have gotten spoiled and like the online streaming because I can watch the service again, later.",[seeker] There are days when I am closed up in my room wanting to feel sorry for myself that I take great comfort in watching the service again.,[supporter] Can you send messages so the church knows you r ok,"[seeker] I do, and my pastor is wonderful about chatting with me on Facebook every day or so.","[seeker] Just a couple weeks ago, he brought me a giant care package full of food and snacks to help keep me going and relieve the boredom.",[supporter] can you sign language the service and send it back for the church to reach others,[seeker] No...

I have a friend who is a certified interpreter who has sent me video showing me the correct way to sign certain songs.,[supporter] So you have a way to sign for others.,"[seeker] At the moment, I have no way, but that's okay.  Since there is no one in the congregation who signs at the moment, I am not needed in that role.",[supporter] You are Just like that little girl,"Also, something else happened regarding my church family.

I have an extremely difficult time falling asleep.. and whenever I do manage to fall asleep.. i wake up always feeling like crap. I never feel rested no matter how long i sleep.,"[supporter] I have had trouble sleeping in the past and sometimes I still do, usually if it is when I'm nervous about the future.","[supporter] The number one way I have had to help my depression is to pray and read scripture. I don't know if you are a Christian, but that has helped me a lot. The second way is to have a good friend who will listen, not someone who will TELL me what to do or judge me, but someone who can empathize with me. A good listener is worth her weight in gold.",[seeker] I've learned that mines not really an emotional thing. I feel like my sleeping issue causes my depression. Because no matter what- i always feel exhausted. Nothing has helped it besides medication. It just sucks always feeling fatigued and energyless. I actually did take up religion here this year to help with the coping that comes with this. It was very helpful for a while there,"[supporter] If I didn't get good rest, then I would definitely feel tired the next day and over time, it would wear me out. I believe medication will help with the symptoms, but it is important to get the root of the problem, why exactly you find it difficult to sleep.","[supporter] Sometimes I take a benydryl because they always make me sleepy, but I usually know why I need to relax, I'm nervous about the next day. So I have found it important to know WHY I don't rest well, if that makes sense to you.",[seeker] I plan on seeing a sleep doctor soon! Sometimes I lose sight of fixing the issue and need to be reminded. And yes!! I was treating my sleeping with Benadryl as well but it wasn't healthy to keep doing that.,"[supporter] I'm also thinking there are a few practical ways you can help yourself sleep. I was advised to get soft sheets, make my sleeping area more restful, make sure the time before bed is relaxing and calming.","[supporter] I also was helped a lot by a Christian Preacher, he's long dead, but he has audio on youtube -- Frank Hammond, Pigs in the Parlor. It's a 5 part series I found helpful, you might want to jot that down.  And I do encourage you to find a counselor, once you rule out the physical (doctor) then you can look at emotional, mental and/or spiritual. I think most of everything is spiritual and emotional to some degree, and our body just responds to that.",[seeker] I always lose sight of how to make things better. It really helps to talk sometimes so someone can help me put things into perspective. I'll look into Frank Hammond! I am actually religious and would love to look into that.,"[supporter] I will definitely pray for you tonight because I know losing sleep is hard to deal with. But please have hope, sometimes we go through these things to possible get to deeper issues that might need to be dealt with. We only have a few minutes here, but I'm pretty old and I have found this to be true so many times.  Get a good support system of good friends. Having people who ""get"" you is SO vital to our lives. And learning to be grateful helps too. And especially journal, find out what may be bothering you.","[supporter] I had some abuse issues and that is why I had a hard time resting.

You can go for therapy and talk things over even if you don't have that big of a problem.",[seeker] no I have not done any medical appointments since earlier this year.,[supporter] Exactly! I totally agree. I love just talking to my therapist. It's so nice just to have someone listen and give feedback that isn't a friend.,[seeker] I will once I get some more done for my work at home.,[seeker] I see. That's great that you do that. Excellent,[supporter] Therapy is shown to really help so I strongly suggest doing that if you have the time and money. It really will help.,[seeker] Yeah I will definitely keep it on my list and won't rule it out,[seeker] I do need to go to my family doctor in person though as I need an annual checkup at least,[seeker] like even the dentist I haven't gone since last year.,[supporter] Yes that is important.

I find myself biting my tongue more than once every day when I hear his opinions about the work.","[supporter] Oh yes, I totally get that! I remember having to do the exact same thing, very frustrating!",,,,,,,,,"Also, something else happened that I didn't mention. I overheard the new manager talking about my performance, and I'm not sure if it's true, but it sounded like he wants to get rid of me.",That sounds concerning. Can you share more about what you heard and how it made you feel?,"I can't say for sure what he meant, but it felt pretty alarming. I might be wrong about it, but it sounds like he doesn't want me around.","Even without knowing all the details, it clearly suggests that he is threatened by your skills and might be trying to undermine you.",FALSE,,

I myself have been in the position of loss of income and financial insecurity in the past, and while it was hard while I was in the valley, I was able to walk out of it with some valuable lessons.","[seeker] That is true, I just have to work hard for myself. I am learning valuable lessons like the idea that companies don't care about their workers, etc. Working more on myself sounds like the better option.",[supporter] It sounds like you are already identifying areas of self improvement. A person with confidence in themselves and the ability to reflect and grow are promising attributes potential employers look for.,"[seeker] Thank you for all that you've done today, I couldn't get through it without you dude.","[seeker] Thank you for your time today, hearing my concerns about the future!",[supporter] You are so welcome. I know that you will succeed in your employment search as you have the skills and humility that potential employers are looking for.,"[seeker] I'll continue to keep on the lookout for new job opportunities, as well as improving myself for the long term. I appreciate it!","[supporter] As you continue your job search, can you think of ways that you could trim your cost of living for the short term? Returning to the basics for a time could help save you money while you take the next steps with your career. Things like planning meals ahead of time, using items you already have instead of buying new, letting go of subscriptions you don't use daily or don't deem necessary.","[seeker] I could definitely reduce my spending like going out less for fast food, cutting my Netflix and Hulu subscriptions, and prepare my own meals for the next week weeks, as I try to find a new job. This would definitely help with my concerns about income and financial security.","[supporter] Our lifestyle seems to be all about convenience and instant gratification, I myself being guilty of wanting those as well. But I think when we strip our needs down to the basics for a while we allow ourselves to find what is really necessary, as well as what is truly important to us.","[seeker] Very true, people definitely need to find their fitting for when things go wrong. Failure or bad events give us time to think about the important things in life, as well as our true needs.","[supporter] And it is important to remember that everyone goes through cycles of feast or famine, and that when you are walking through a famine you yourself are not a failure. As long as you know you are doing your best to succeed under the circumstances you have been handed, you will never truly be a failure to yourself or to others.",,,,,,,"Also, something else happened recently that I didn't mention. I overheard some people at work saying that they might be laying off more employees soon, but I'm not sure if it's true.",That sounds concerning. Do you have any idea about how many more layoffs they might be considering or when that could happen?,I can't tell for sure. It's unclear if those rumors are just speculation or if there's some truth behind them.,"Even without knowing all the details, it clearly shows that your current job situation is unstable, and it would be wise to start looking for new opportunities immediately.",FALSE,,
838,V1,My girlfriend just told me our relationship isn't working by text. She has recently started a new job and I think she may have met someone else.,"[supporter] It is but that is a lot of change all happening at once. Perhaps she is getting a little bit scared and rather than dealing with the situation she is running away, perhaps you should talk about this and see how she responds?",[seeker] I still think there is someone else that has come between us.,[supporter] Have you got any evidence of this like seen a text message or has she behaves strangely?,"[seeker] No I haven't, it is just a feeling.",[supporter] Ok well it is natural to feel like this sometimes. People tend to fear the worst.,[seeker] So do you think I should try and talk to her and ask her outright if she has met someone else?,"[supporter] I think rather than ask her that question directly, you could start the conversation and ask her why she is feeling this way. This would show you care and are prepared to listen without jumping to conclusions.",[seeker] I think I do need to calm down a bit and maybe talking to her would be the best way to start. I don;t know what I'd do though if she ended it.,"[supporter] The best thing to do would be prepared to have the conversation, stay calm and listen. She may just want to talk but also be prepared as it may not go the way you plan.",[seeker] Ok well maybe if I show her that I can stay calm and strong then she will stay with me?,[supporter] Be prepared that she may end the relationship but getting angry is likely not to change her mind. Getting angry does not improve difficult conversations.,"[seeker] I suppose I could go into it and listen as you have said, there could be other reasons like the new job or maybe morning in that is causing some of it. I'll try and keep calm but it is hard when emotions run high.",[supporter] Take a deep breath and try to relax beforehand. Staying positive and allowing her to speak will make for a better conversation. She will be more likely to open up to you.,,,,,,,,"Also, something else happened... I overheard a conversation where she mentioned wanting to invite someone else to a work event, but I couldn't catch the details.",That sounds concerning.

My ex-fiance cheated on me and got pregnant with another man, so I know how rough this type of thing is.",[supporter] Have you been able to talk to him about it yet?,"[seeker] At this point, I don't want to talk, I am so disgusted I want nothing more to do with him, regardless of the kids.",[supporter] Have you talked to the kids about it? It will be important for them to understand what is going on and why.,"[seeker] The kids are pretty smart, they found out and was mad at first, but now they are accepting, which is making me even more disgusted. I have even started to resent my kids for it.","[supporter] I think it would help to sit down and have a conversation with them about it. It is important that they know how you feel and that you are there for them, and that they aren't the reason for the issues.","[seeker] I did at least sit down with the kids about it, told t hem how I felt, explained the nature of the situation. But they weren't on my side, they acted like they were on my side at first but then switched up on me, made me feel like I was the one wrong!?!",[supporter] Have you thought about seeking a group of people who have been through this same situation that you are going through now? It often helps to talk to people who have been through the same things and get their help to get through the situation.,[seeker] Apparently that's you smh lol.. How did you feel? What did you do?,[supporter] This is true I suppose. I made sure to have a conversation with her first in order to get some closure on the situation. After that I focused on more of my hobbies that I hadn't been able to do in a while in order to keep my mind distracted and off of the situation.,[seeker] I'm still not ready to have that conversation with him. He's acting like I made him cheat on me. Maybe I should find some hobbies to distract myself until I can myself to that point.,[supporter] I think that would definitely help!,,,,,,"Also, something else happened that worries me.

Have you had a chance to confront him about what you've heard?,I haven't confronted him yet. I'm unsure if it's accurate or just people talking.

I know it would be hard, but possibly try to remember your friend wouldn't hurt you and find what your friend wants to convey to you.","Also, something else happened... I overheard someone say they thought he was unhappy before he died.",What did they mean by that?

It's scary.,"[supporter] I understand completely. Depression runs in my family and if it goes untreated, can scare anyone that is involved.

Your main goal is to check on him and make sure that he is okay since he seems to want to be alone and not talk to anyone. Once he tells you how he is doing you could mention that even talking to someone about his thoughts and feelings could lift a weight off his shoulders.

I would like to have it done before christmas. How about some wooden toys or a cardboard box fort?,"[supporter] I have seen some people make small ornaments filled with candies and treats and other small goodies.

I remember that morning like it was yesterday.  He got killed within an hour after leaving the house on his way to work.,[supporter] He was killed so soon after you last saw him?,[seeker] Very soon.  And the worst thing is I was upset with him that morning.  He had an addiction to xanax.  I was not ok with it.  He had went and got some that morning and he would always give them to me so I could give them to him so he didn't take them all.  I was so upset that he went and got them.  He was packing up his truck with things to take to the new shop that day.  He was a tattoo artist and just started a new job.  I didn't even get out of bed to help him and he knew I was upset with him.,[supporter] Have you considered any sort of bereavement counselling? Addiction in a partner is a very hard thing to have to deal with. It is not your fault!,[seeker] I had decided that I was gonna wait to hear from him that day instead of texting or calling him.  I wanted him to realize how upset his addiction made me. Instead the phone call I got was that he had been killed.,"[supporter] Do you feel any sort of guilt about it? You should not, of course, but do you wonder if things would have been different if you had talked to him first?",[seeker] I haven't done any counseling.  I know I should and it would probably help me.  I don't know why I have not.,[supporter] I have previously had counselling and found it very useful but there is a long waiting list for a free counsellor,[seeker] I don't feel guilt about it.  Now at least.  I was pretty hard on myself at first.  But I know that he knows why I was upset that morning.  It was something we dealt with a lot.,[supporter] Are you still in touch with his family and friends?,[seeker] I went and talked to a therapist once right after and never went back.

What do you do when you see it happening?,[seeker] I usually just document it and try to not go online for a while. It is hard to ignore,[supporter] It sounds like you are avoiding things you enjoy because of their actions. I think documenting it is a good idea! Have you tried reporting them for harassing you?,[seeker] I have tried but everyone just tells me there is nothing they can do because they don't think it is dangerous or criminal at this point,[supporter] That must be very frustrating. Can you tell me if you’ve tried other things to get them to stop?,[seeker] I have confronted them in person but it was dramatic to say the least. They basically had a meltdown that they don't want to lose me,"[supporter] You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter.

It must be overwhelming at times and make you dread the weekends. It sounds like it has become a habit for your ex. It might help if you write a letter to them explaining that you are ready to move on and are asking them to do the same. Explain that you are giving them the opportunity to stop harassing you in the following ways [list some of the details you have documented]. Inform them that if they do not stop, you are considering taking it further regarding harassing communications and that this letter serves as your intention to no longer tolerate their actions. Send it via certified mail and keep a copy. This will give them no way to immediately respond and would be the first step of official documentation should they decide to continue.  Do you think that might help?",[seeker] I think that is an excellent idea! That is a good way to end this once and for all.,"[supporter] I sincerely hope it is a step toward you regaining your control  over how you are able to interact with people.

I typically get bad anxiety after a night of going out. So I am trying to cut out drinking.,[supporter] So you feel that the drinking itself gives you the anxiety?  Do you suffer from anxiety when you do not drink ever?,"[seeker] Sometimes but I think the root from them comes from when I do something while I'm drinking. Not that I do anything bad, but I just  don't like not remembering things.",[supporter] So you would say that you drink to the point of blacking out? Or you just seem to get foggy on details when you've had a reasonable amount of alcohol?,"[seeker] I used to black out a lot, but I have tried to control it by cutting the former amount of drinks I consumed in half, if I do choose to go out.",[supporter] I have drank to the point of blacking out several times in my life mostly when I was younger and I found that it either came from a certain type of alcohol or mixing different types.  Have you noticed it could be related to that or simply the amount of alcohol you are drinking?,"[seeker] It is typically the amount I'm drinking, but cutting out drinking as a whole has probably helped me the most.",[supporter] Certainly making sure that you only drink a certain amount like a couple drinks of beer or only a shot of harder drinks might alleviate this or refraining from mixing drinks.  Sometimes also it could be due to the company you keep...the amount you drink.  Do your friends encourage you to drink more?,"[seeker] They don't necessarily attempt to get me to drink more in volume, but I do have to tell them I'm not gonna go out for the night.",[supporter] Are they okay with it when you decline?,,,,,"Also, something else happened... I overheard a friend mention that they think I might be drinking to cope with something deeper, but I'm not sure if it's true or just their opinion.",What do you think they might be referring to? Is there something specific that makes you think about your drinking habits?,"I can't tell for sure what they meant. It could be related to stress at school, but I haven't confirmed anything with them.","Even without knowing all the details, it clearly means your friends are concerned about your well-being and drinking might be a bigger issue than you realize.",FALSE,,
358,V1,can't focus,[seeker] I cannot seem to focus on online learn. FU covid,[supporter] It must be very difficult to be a student during this time.,[seeker] It is so weird. I am a hands on. teacher talking to me kinda person. what the F,"[supporter] I understand that completely. It's very helpful to speak with people face to face. However, have you sought other ways, such as through Zoom, to interact with peers having the same difficulties?",[seeker] zoom is not the same. I am in a techincal trade and need my hands,[supporter] Classes that involve hands-on work must be very challenging to do online. It sounds like this is a real dilemma. What ways have you already sought to overcome it?,[seeker] trying to stay sane (patient) that the vaccine works and we get back to normal soon. FU lockdown,"[supporter] I feel very much the same way. I am also a student taking online classes this semester. I can't wait until we get back to normal classroom settings, and I also hope fervently that the vaccine process is quick, efficient, and effective. I find that making regular online meetings with my professor, while it might not help with the physicality of your work, at least provides mental and motivational boosts. Do you ever meet with them in any capacity?",[seeker] honestly its all a shit show right now. Everything is tied up in logistics and stop and starts. this year has been almost a wash,[supporter] It's been the same way at my school. At least there is some solace in knowing that a large group of students is also struggling right now. Having a source of community support/commiseration is at least emotionally helpful.,"[seeker] true, I guest if the ship goes down we all go down","[supporter] If there's only one thing to take from this, it's knowing you aren't alone. I have confidence that you, and this entire country, is going to get through these difficult times.",,,,,,,,,"Also, something else happened... I heard from a classmate that some instructors might not return next semester. I'm not sure if it's true.",That sounds concerning.

This has rubbed off on their 5 year old daughter.,"[seeker] And, I am thankful she trusts us with what is going on. They both need support and strength.",[supporter] Yes I completely understand. It's a very delicate situation. I've read multiple times that it takes an average of 7 times to leave an abusive relationship (even though I think I tried even more times than that). She will hopefully one day gather the courage to realize she doesn't deserve to be treated badly,[supporter] You are amazing for being her support!,"[seeker] Yeah, she has a good support system with her Mon and a couple very close friends.","[seeker] It;s one day at a time, listening and being available.",[supporter] That's seriously great to hear!

Recipe for love.",[supporter] <3 agreed. Unconditional support is everything.,,,,,"Also, something else happened...

I hope you can tide-over this hard time soon and you are doing your best at this time. So proud!",[seeker] Thank you I appreciate that! Yes I am getting surgery like 2 days before christmas so this christmas should definitely be interesting to say the least haha.,[supporter] Ohhh that sucks. I am happy to yo don't lose your fun and you are not pessimist which is good and it might help for your health. Always try to see the bright side,[seeker] Yes exactly. I got my teeth fixed a couple days ago as well so that was good too! I am really leaning on my family for support but just felt like asking for some outside help which is why I am talking to you right now lol.,"[supporter] Exactly, sometimes we need new window to see things by different ankle. So can I ask you what you want me to do or what is really need you right now ?",,,,,,,,"Also, something else happened that I didn't mention before. I heard from a friend that my dentist might not be available for the surgery due to personal reasons, and I'm not sure if that's true.",That's concerning. What did your friend say about your dentist's situation? Have you reached out to the dentist's office for confirmation?,"I haven't confirmed anything yet. It's unclear what is actually happening with the dentist, but I feel a bit anxious about it.","Even without knowing all the details, it seems like you should look for another dentist just in case this one is unavailable which clearly means you are at risk of delays in your treatment.",FALSE,,

I can relate to feeling anxious. You are not alone.,[supporter] What do you think is triggering your anxiety?,[seeker] I think it might be the fear of failure that triggered it,"[supporter] Research has shown that fear of failure does stem from feelings of anxiety, but is it possible to look at fear of failure from a different perspective?",[seeker] I think it might be possible to look at it from a different perspective,[supporter] Do you think you can channel your fear of failure into positive energy?,[seeker] I think I probably could,[seeker] How do you think I could do that?,[supporter] You can turn your anxiety into extra energy to plan and prepare.,"[supporter] Having anxiety can give you a boost of energy, which gives you an advantage to achieve your goal.","[seeker] I can probably do that, the anxiety can motivate me to create a studying plan","[supporter] Yes, indeed. Having anxiety will keep you anchored to your study plan which would increase your ability to perform well for the exam.",[seeker] I can do that,"[supporter] Awesome! In addition, as you follow your study plan, remember to pace yourself.","Also, something else happened. I heard that some students are starting to cheat on their finals.",That sounds concerning.

I really have no one to talk to because my family and friends didn't like him so they think this is for the best.",[supporter] Ok. I am happy to listen.,[seeker] I just don't understand why someone would pretend to be happy for a year and then decide they were lying and leave,"[supporter] Seems like you feel your partner betrayed you, does that sound right?","[seeker] Yes, I feel very betrayed.","[supporter] That is understandable. I know how you feel,  may I suggest taking a few minutes to clear your head, and making a plan to talk with your friends and parents about how you feel?",[seeker] They think I should just get over it because they didn't like him so they think I shouldn't like him either.,[seeker] They're making things worse for me.,"[supporter] Oh I'm so sorry, sometimes family and friends don't think about your feelings.  When did this happen?",[seeker] He left yesterday.  I had no warning.  He just packed up all his stuff and said he didn't want to marry me and the last year has been a lie.,[supporter] Dang. he seems very selfish. But I understand how up setting it must have felt. My first husband left me without warning.,[seeker] I'm sorry to hear that.  How long did it take you to feel better?,"[supporter] Awhile. it started to feel a little bit better after I kept telling myself it was about him and not about me, then I started feeling a bit better.

I overheard a friend of his say that he might actually be seeing someone else.",That sounds really concerning.

My days tend to go better.",[seeker] I've been finding I have a lot of time alone with my thoughts recently.,"[seeker] That's a good idea, I could try that.

But it will only last about 2 months.,"[supporter] I know. This is the worst time of year for this news. Surprisingly, it happens very often.",[supporter] Having 2 months of savings is FANTASTIC! More than most people.,[seeker] Yea. We have been saving snice the start of Covid. I knew this day would come it just hard at this time.,[supporter] Do you anticipate any roadblocks to finding new employment in your industry?,[supporter] I understand your feelings.

Perhaps, think about as looking forward to a better opportunity in your future?",[seeker] Yes I am thinking on Sunday would be good and maybe by gods help we will have a stimulus deal.,"[supporter] The stimulus has helped a lot of people get through this tough time. Sounds like you will feel much more secure knowing that you will have some income, and not have to use your savings that you worked so hard for.",[seeker] Yes and that will allow me to keep working as well. Which I want to do. I love my job.,"[supporter] It's a wonderful thing to love your job. I love mine, as well, and would feel bad if it were put at risk.",[seeker] Thanks I'm so glad I was able to chat with you.

You have demonstrated that you can take care of yourself and your family.",[seeker] Thank you. So much for your help and kind words. You saved my Christmas spirt.,"[supporter] I can say that many friends of mine have found new jobs, most have left their old ones willingly for new opportunities. There are out there.",,,,"Also, something else happened. I overheard that some of my coworkers might be laid off too, but I'm not sure if it's true.",That's concerning.

Have you tried reaching out to their family members as they may have a loser handle on how this person is feeling at the moment?",[seeker] I actually haven't. I'm not that close to their family to be honest so I'm  not quite sure how to do that?,"[supporter] You could try reaching out to friends on Facebook or social media, you can find contact details for them that way and perhaps send them a direct message. You are a concerned friend which means they probably wouldn't mind if you did get in touch.",[seeker] I didn't think about contacting family that way. That's a good suggestion.,[supporter] I had a friend once that was acting out of character. They weren't quiet but I could tell them here was something different in the way they were acting etc. It turns out that they had started a new relationship with another friend of mine and didn't want anyone else to know. In reality everything was fine. There was an explainable reason behind the behaviour and it was nothing bad in the end.,[seeker] Perhaps I am worried about nothing and your experience does make sense. I may be reading too much into these things but you read about people's mental health being affected by COVID isolation these days.,[supporter] That is true. Mental health issues have increased  significantly since lockdowns began,"[supporter] As they are not responding to your attempts to get in touch, you could think has anything else changed for them other than lockdown, for example are they busier at work? have childcare commitments? Life is complicated, they may not have the time for legitimate reasons.",,,,,,,"Also, something else happened. I heard from a mutual friend that they might be seeing someone new, but I'm not sure if it's true.",That's interesting. How did your mutual friend come to know about this?

I tried to tell her that I was busy with some work, but she thought I was lying to her and now I'm very sad.",[supporter] I understand how you are feeling about that I would be upset to.,[seeker] What should I do to still be friends with her? I don't know what to do anymore!,[supporter] Have you tried to talk to her again recently?,[seeker] Yes. I even texted her and called her. She opened my messages but didn't respond and she even ignored my calls.,[supporter] I would give her 2 or 3 days to her self then try to talk to her again,[seeker] Its been more than 3 days and I have given her time. I don't think I can wait longer. I might loose her.,[supporter] Maybe you should go up to her house,[seeker] Due to the COVID cases right now I am trying to not risk the safety of others and myself. I don't know that going up to her house would be the best option at this moment :(,[supporter] Right i can understand,[seeker] We have been friends for so many years and I do not know why she is acting like that. I do not want to loose this precious friendship.,[supporter] I would suggest just keep trying to talk to her and apologize and tell her you been really busy and was not trying to ignore her,[supporter] Send her a apology card in the mail,[seeker] I appreciate your suggestions.

How are you?,"[supporter] Trying to be positive about the dumpster fire of 2020 lol, but positivity is kind of hard to maintain wouldn't you say?","[seeker] It really, really is. Things just pile up, you know?",[supporter] Totally! It's hard to plan for success when life seems a bit uncertain. Is there anything in particular that's bothering you?,"[seeker] It's a combination of things. I have no idea what I'm doing most days, just kind of going through the motions. Kind of like Groundhog Day, repeating the same day over and over with slightly different variations. Trying to get things done and taken care of, thinking I'm doing my best and feeling like it's never good enough. Feeling like I'm failing all the time.","[supporter] Ah yes, the cog in the machine sort of vibe. Boy do I feel that. Well, the good thing is your not alone.

I have a few friends that no matter how long you discuss, they won't let the conversation end unless ""they are right."" It seems like your friend doesn't like it when he is wrong?",[seeker] Absolutely and I'm not sure how to broach this with him. I actually feel like it is damaging his reputation.  Other friends of ours feel the same way. Not sure what to do?,"[supporter] Gotcha so not only are you frustrated with what he is doing, but you are also worried about his reputation! First of all, can I ask if he is just your friend online or if you hangout with him in person too?",[seeker] That's correct. He is actually a close friend and I wonder what has changed recently to make him like this. I've known him for over 20 years.,"[supporter] Okay I see. From personal experience, the best way to confront someone who likes to do most of their confrontations online, is in person. Since he is so used to almost ""hiding"" behind a screen, his feelings will be more vulnerable and real if you discuss your concerns in person.",[seeker] Actually I've never thought of it like that. Perhaps a couple of us can have a conversation with him in person. Honestly some off his views are disgusting.

I will believe that too.,"[supporter] I am glad I can make your day just a little better, that's what we are here for ^_^",[seeker] It really did help.

Wouldn't it be better to save the money and hedge my bets?,[supporter] It seems that you are mixed up in the decision to put in extra funds in a professional resume polish or use your time and energy instead of actual financial means. Is that right?,[seeker] Exactly. I'm anxious that if I don't get professional help I won't land a job but then on the other hand I'm anxious that if I don't get a job I'll have needed the savings.,"[supporter] Perhaps you should speak to a trusted mentor or a closed loved one and seek their opinion. Often, we need someone outside of the actual situation that can give us great advice.",[seeker] That's a good idea too. Maybe even someone who recently changed jobs can give me some interview tips! -Even if I get the interview I know I'm going to be anxious about that!,"[supporter] I understand we can all feel anxious during an interview, but remember what great qualities you can bring to the table and believe in yourself!",[seeker] I'll try!

411,V1,Really dislike my job in this current environment and would like to try online sales,[supporter] So you are feeling unsatisfied in your work but you are not sure how to change ?,[seeker] yes but more so not wanting to change due to uncertainty regarding what I may be walking into,"[supporter] I have been in this same position! Sometimes you have to take a leap, even though you are not sure what might happen. So far everything has worked out fine for me.",[seeker] That's true. I just don't want to lose the benefits that I am currently entitled to at my current bad job,"[supporter] It is a tricky situation, to be sure. Have you talked to anyone else about it?","[seeker] yes my wife, and she is supportive either way so that's not a problem",[supporter] I am glad to hear that you have someone supportive in your life. What is your current line of work?,[seeker] e-commerce manager for walmart stores inc,[supporter] Would you like a total change? Or just a change of scenery?,"[seeker] looking to work exclusively at home in sales which is more my specialization, so yes to both questions",[supporter] Online work can be very lucrative. I have been doing it for years personally. It is nice to be your own boss and choose your own hours.,[seeker] I currently do day trading on the side and make great money at it but want something stable to challenge me,[supporter] It is true that stability is important. Do I hear you say that you are frightened of the insecurity of working from home?,"[seeker] more so the lack of benefits I would lose, especially healthcare",[supporter] Ah .. I am in the UK so we have socialised medicine :). Would you feel more comfortable if you lived in a country like that?,[seeker] lol definitely! Currently I pay $750 monthly if I purchase healthcare on my own but only $163 monthly through my work,[supporter] Goodness .. I do not have to pay anything. Also our prescriptions are fixed at about ten pounds each.,[supporter] I think maybe your job dilemma would be easier if you moved to a different country :D,[seeker] I would lose about $3000 monthly leaving my job,[supporter] You might be able to make that much from home though. And what's life if you don't take the odd risk?,"Also, something else happened... I heard from a coworker that there might be layoffs coming soon, but I'm not sure if it's true.",That sounds concerning. Have you heard any specifics about how likely those layoffs are?,I haven't confirmed anything and it's unclear who exactly the layoffs might affect.,"Even without knowing all the details, it clearly means you should start considering your options seriously.",FALSE,,
1084,V1,"My manager has decided that everyone will continue to work from home nearly 100% of the time after the pandemic is under control. (Prior to the pandemic, most of us only had one work-from-home day a week.) I really love the work I do, but I've been experiencing depression this past year largely due to my lack of human contact throughout the work day.","[seeker] Well, my manager has decided that everyone in the office will continue to work from after the pandemic is under control. But I've found myself depressed from working from home all the time.",[supporter] Working from home is not what people expected. Many have found themselves isolated. They miss the interaction of the office. How long have you bee working from home?,"[seeker] For a full year--since March 2020, when the pandemic first started. I was working from home just 1 day per week prior to that, which I liked. But I've found that 5 days per week is much too much. I miss people. :(","[supporter] Have you and your co-workers talked to your boss about a hybrid schedule, maybe a couple days a week in the office? That might work.","[seeker] That's where it gets awkward. It seems like everyone besides me are super happy that we'll continue working from home. I hesitate to share my feelings because maybe my manager will change her mind, which would be a big bummer for everyone else on the team (seemingly).","[supporter] I see. That's a concern. So you feel that if one person goes in to the office, then everyone else will have to? There won't be any flexibility?","[seeker] Well, it's possible that my manager will say we can be flexible. But if so, I think I'd end up being the only one in my office working... which would be just as lonely as working from home while throwing away the few perks of working from home, like saving on gas. Plus, I think my company will probably want to repurpose our office space eventually.","[seeker] lol, sorry, that was an ugly run-on sentence. :\","[supporter] Hm. A bit of a dilemma. Can this situation go on forever though? Maybe the boss will extend the stay-at-home for a while, but when other companies go back to the office, the expectation will be there for all companies.",[supporter] Other employees might change their minds bit by bit as well.,"[seeker] That is indeed a possibility. But my office is in a city that has a whole lot of high-tech companies, which were moving towards doing more work from home even BEFORE the pandemic. So it kind of feels like this might be a ""cultural shift"" in my area in general. Although there has GOT to be a whole lot of other people who feel like I do. Maybe we should start our own company, lol.",[supporter] True. I don't think you are alone. Is there something that you can do to make working at home better for you? More frequent breaks? Better work space?,[seeker] That's a good question. My state is still one of the ones that's mostly shut-down. Part of my depression surely stems from the fact that all evening/weekend activities ended a year ago as well.,[supporter] True. It might be easier to work at home when you have a chance to get out of the house during your free time.,"[seeker] That's true. And your suggestion of improving my work space is a good one. I've been working in a modified walk-in closet. I've tried to make it inviting, but there are no windows/etc.... it's kind of a dark cave.","[supporter] Most people didn't plan for the long term because nobody thought that this was a sustainable way to work. By the way, if your company wants you to stay home, then it might help buy the equipment you need to be productive.","[seeker] That's a good thought. My computer is set-up on a folding card table. (I tried finding a desk a while back, but there was a huge shortage since everyone suddenly had to buy them for themselves, kids, etc.). I hadn't thought of asking my company to buy me one. Plus a more comfy chair could improve my attitude.","[supporter] I think if you talk to your co-workers, they'll have ideas for upgrading your workspace.",,,"Also, something else happened...

She never liked me and now she gets to make me suffer.,"[supporter] I am very sorry to hear that - trouble with workmates, especially those who are in a higher position, can make things very miserable can't they?",[seeker] They really can.  I used to love my job and my team.  Now she has made everyone miserable because she just doesn't care about learning the job or the job at all.  My morale is low and worse because I can't help my peers who are struggling as well.,[supporter] Have you considered going over her head and putting in a complaint? Especially if she is making everyone else miserable as well. Someone more senior might be able to do something.,"[seeker] I have considered this many times.  Unfortunately, the next level manager doesn't respect or value my team in general.  She has made that clear.  She's also just awful and uncomfortable to talk to.  I've found her to just be mean sometimes.  It just feels so hopeless.  Just waiting for someone to notice.  Just hoping she fails.",[seeker] It's just really hard to show up everyday.  But I do.  Although the days are long and exhausting with no motivation to perform.,[supporter] Please try to stay positive - bullies never prosper in the long term. I think that you need to talk to your co-workers about this and see if you can come to some sort of arrangement between you,"[supporter] Alternatively, have you ever considered seeking another job? I know that that might feel like selling out but you might be happier somewhere else","[seeker] You are right.  She is a bully.  I have called her several names to myself, but not a bully yet.  My coworkers and I have discussed what options we may have.  My suggestion was that we work at our normal pace rather than scrambling to make up for her failures.  I wouldn't want to set her up, but I think her failing is the only way we will ever see a solution.","[seeker] I have applied for another job within my company.  There seems to be interest in me, so that's exciting.  It is a job I really want.  But then, of course, I feel bad about leaving my peers behind.

I really care about my coworker and it makes me so angry that she treats me this way.,[supporter] I think sometimes it's easy to jump to anger when you feel hurt.

Make it a partnership rather than a fight for whose method is better.,[supporter] She could feel threatened by you so it's worth digging into those feelings with her and proving to her that you're working toward the same goal.,[seeker] That's a great idea.

I am lost without him.,[supporter] Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that.

Now his family won't talk to me either.,[supporter] that must be horrible. You were already engaged?,"[seeker] Yes, we were only engaged for about a month but we have been friends since childhood.",[supporter] that sounds really hard. that's a long time to know someone.,[supporter] how long ago did you breka up?,"[seeker] Yeah, it was basically my whole life. We broke up two nights ago and he already changed his number and blocked my on social media.","[supporter] that's going to be tough for the next little bit, those sound like some pretty fresh wounds. Have you been able to talk to friends?","[seeker] I would like to talk to talk to friends but they happen to be his sisters. So, I am cut off from all of my support. Thank You for talking to me.","[supporter] I had a break up last year and while it was painful for a bit, i used it as an opportunity to focus on myself and the things I needed.

Is it hard going alone or do you go with friends? I hate doing things all alone.,"[supporter] I like going to the gym alone but that's just my personal preference. There are fitness groups like bootcamps that you could join and meet new people. Who knows, you may meet a new friend.",,,,,,,,,"Also, something else happened... I overheard his sister mention that he might be seeing someone else now. I'm not sure if it's true, but it hurt to hear.",That sounds really tough to deal with. Did you get any more details on what she said or how she sounded when she mentioned it?,"I didn't really catch the full conversation, so it's unclear if she was serious or just speculating.
