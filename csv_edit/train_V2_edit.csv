"[supporter] I'm sorry to hear that, what is the issue that you're having?","[seeker] She's a year ahead of me in college and will be graduating in May. She's looking at jobs in the northwestern region, but I'd planned on looking at graduate schools in the south. However, we've always planned on living together after college, but my career path would be best served in the southern states. I don't know how to bring this up to her.",[supporter] Is it crucial that you be in the South versus Northwestern region? Are you willing to lose her in order to move South?,[seeker] It ',[seeker] oops,"[seeker] It's not crucial, necessarily, but the population that I want to work with is more relevant along the southern border. I'm not willing to lose her, so to say, but I would like to find a compromise. I don't know what that would be though, or how to bring it up.",[supporter] A compromise would definitely be the best and most fair for both of you. You may just need to sit down and ask some tough questions to determine where she sees things. She may be thinking the same thing you are.,"[supporter] Without knowing where you stand on things or where your relationship is going, she may not know how to completely plan the future for herself much less the two of you.",[seeker] Have you ever been in a situation at all similar?,[supporter] Somewhat but not identical. My now husband and I attended different colleges and we both agreed on a fairly selfish approach of finding our careers while dating and not letting our relationship dictate what either one of us did. No one wants to be the reason someone holds back or gives up on something they've always wanted.,"[seeker] I don't think that's selfish, but knowing your experience is helpful in understanding your advice.","[supporter] You don't want her to resent you for telling her you want her to move South, but that goes both ways. She needs to be willing to see your side too and you'll need to make those decisions together.",[seeker] I appreciate your help! I'll try to have a productive conversation with her soon.,"[supporter] Great, the sooner the better. I have a feeling you'll both be relieved when you do.","[seeker] I agree! I don't know if it's something she's considered, because I've expressed interest in moving to the northwest just for fun, but I've also noted that the schools I'm actually looking at are Arizona and New Mexico. I do think the field she wants to go into could be applicable in almost any state, but I'll be gentle. I don't want to lose her, so if I need to look into a different section of my field, I definitely could.","[supporter] I'm sure she's considered it, expressing interest in both of those areas could just be that you're sending mixed messages too. So really, just talking it out is your best bet. Good luck!",,,,,508,V2,"My friend who's a year ahead of me in school is looking at jobs in an entirely different part of the country that I was looking at grad schools in, but she expects me to follow her there, which had previously been our plan.","Ever since we started talking about post college plans, I have been nervous about how to tell her I might not follow.","You are trying to protect the friendship and your future at the same time, so feeling tense and hesitant is understandable.",I keep second guessing myself. What is the first step you would push me to take?,"It would probably help to say your plan out loud and make it concrete, even if it disappoints her. If you do not state it clearly, she may keep planning as if you are coming, so setting that boundary now is the safer move.",TRUE,1
[supporter] or do you have a common friend that can help arrange a meetup ?,[seeker] I've send him so many messages. He reads them but won't respond. I did ask his best friend to help me but my ex pretended like nothing was wrong when his friend asked him.,[supporter] Hmm. do you want to give him some time to maybe cool off and then try to get in touch with him again?,[supporter] i know you are anxious but sometimes it is best for time to heal things and bring things back to normal,"[seeker] Yes, I guess that is all I can do for now. Since he won't answer and it's putting pressure on us both. However, the anxiety of this is killing me.I can't eat or sleep. I don't know how to handle it for myself. But yes you are right, the one thing I need to do is leave him be for a bit.","[supporter] Do you have any other friend that you can lean for a little bit for support? this will help you get out of anxiety. Maybe, try to get busy with work or spend time on your hobbies. it helps to take your mind off of this thing a bit and will make you a bit less anxious.",[seeker] Thank you I have been trying to do that. Though I don't want to bother my friends too much. I've been keeping myself busy though. Most important is to stay away from my phone. haha.,[supporter] That's good. at least you found ways to get out of the anxiety.,"[supporter] and social media can cause anxiety too, so staying from your phone also helps :)","[seeker] Well it is not helping much. But I guess it will get better over time. I suppose the second I start to feel better, he'll call. haha. It always works that way, right?","[supporter] Yeah. given enough time and when things cool off, people do dwell on their behaviour and often times feel stupid for the way they act. i hope its the same case with your boyfriend as well. I have a feeling he is going to give you a call soon",[seeker] Thank you very much. I really hope so! :),[supporter] you bet :),[seeker] Thanks again! You did make me feel better and i think we are allowed to proceed now :),"[supporter] Nice. i am glad, i could be of some help.",,,,,,763,V2,"My boyfriend broke up with me in a facebook story. He won't tell me why. He won't return my calls or answer my messages. I think it is because I posted something (innocent) that made him jealous. But he is being so cruel. He posts many sad songs to make it seem like he is so hurt by me, but he won't even speak with me. I can't eat or sleep. I'm losing my mind.","I keep checking my phone even though I know he will not answer, and it is making me feel worse.","Being cut off like that in public can really shake you, so it makes sense that you cannot eat or sleep.",I do not feel capable of deciding right now. What would you tell me to do first?,Muting or blocking him for a while is probably the simplest way to stop this from spiraling.,TRUE,1
[supporter] It's going to be very painful for a while because you have been invested 3 years in this relationship. Do you have friends to talk to that can encourage and support you?,[seeker] The messages were about meeting up for a photoshoot at the brooklyn bridge.,[seeker] is that cheating because he lied,"[supporter] I find if they flirt, they already have cheated. Loyalty is something inside a person, or not. Very few will look inside themselves and see why they do this and want to change. If you were married, you would need counseling.",[supporter] Do you meet up with your exes?,"[seeker] i'm still friends with many of my exes, but he knows that and we all hang out together",[seeker] thats why it's weird that he lied,[supporter] He lied because he didn't want you to know the truth. Which is betrayal.,"[seeker] also, when he gets home, how do i tell him how i found out.","[seeker] i mean, i literally got into his facebook without asking",[seeker] i just had this intuition that he was being suspicious,"[supporter] It's a hot mess, is it not? Why did you feel you wanted to spy on him? Did you already mistrust him?","[seeker] well, it was weird that he got so dressed up to go hang out with friends",[seeker] it makes sense now that i know he went for a photoshoot,"[supporter] Ok, so this is a HUGE red flag to you. You can ignore it, or not. Women KNOW when a man is cheating, so you had that inside of you. And you went with your hunch and now you have found he is dishonest.",[supporter] Was the photoshoot to have pictures of him?,"[seeker] yeah, she's a photographer","[seeker] she took all his headshots when he first moved to America, actually",[seeker] when they were together,"[supporter] I suppose it could be Christmas pictures of him for you? Or not. I personally feel honesty is the best policy, no matter what. I would come clean. I would tell him I sensed trouble and looked for it and found it.",408,V2,I found out my boyfriend went to see his ex and I don't know if I should break up with him or not.,"Since I found out he saw his ex, I cannot stop replaying what that means for us.","When trust feels shaky, even small details can feel huge, so your uneasiness is not surprising.",I want a clear direction because I keep going back and forth. Which way would you lean?,"If he cannot be straightforward and respectful about boundaries, ending it is likely the option that protects you most. A direct conversation for clarity is fine, but if he dodges or minimizes it, that is your answer.",TRUE,1
"[seeker] Not so well, I have been really upset lately.",[supporter] I'm sorry to hear that. what's going on?,"[seeker] I was recently let go from my job due to the covid pandemic, and am now jobless before the holidays","[supporter] I'm sorry, that's tough anytime but that's gotta be brutal because of the year and upcoming holidays.",[supporter] what kind of work were you doing?,"[seeker] It really is, I was in a family owned cafe as a waitress. Due to the rise of the virus they ordered everyone to shut back down",[supporter] I'm sorry to hear that. did they leave you with a severance package of any kind or anything?,"[seeker] No they didnt, And the unemployment has been taking forever. I'm now almost 3 weeks without pay.",[supporter] Oh good so you've already applied for unemployment?,"[seeker] I have, It's just really upsetting knowing that bigger chains are open but We shad to shut down",[supporter] I'm guessing the unemployment office is pretty backlogged right now but at least you've got that done so far.,[supporter] have you applied anywhere yet?,"[seeker] Yeah, I suppose. And I have, but haven't heard back from anywhere yet.",[supporter] End of year is tough with all the companies re budgeting for the following year. I'm betting things will open up early next year.,[seeker] I hope so. This has just been a crappy year all together.,[supporter] Have you considered gig economy jobs like uber or the grocery pickup apps?,"[seeker] I'm unable to do uber due to the age of my vehicle, but never thought about the grocery pickup.",[supporter] You'd need a vehicle for that too but there are plenty of other gig jobs out there. you should take a look.,[supporter] It may be an opportunity to test another kind of work,,403,V2,"I have recently been let go from my job due to the pandemic, and I have been feeling sad lately.","Getting let go has left me heavy and unmotivated, and I cannot figure out what kind of job to aim for next.","Losing work can hit your mood and your confidence at the same time, so feeling sad and stuck fits the situation.",I am overwhelmed by options. What is the next move you would pick for me?,A practical short term job like grocery delivery can reduce pressure quickly while you plan a better fit. Picking that route now is more stabilizing than waiting for clarity to appear.,TRUE,1
"[supporter] I'm so sorry to hear that, that's terrible. Does she not see it as a problem that they're cousins?",[seeker] I advised her not to betray me,[seeker] but she did not honest with me,[supporter] What can I help you with? She clearly isn't right for you.,[seeker] and finally in an argument she break up with me,[seeker] but i love her very much even though she left me,"[supporter] I understand that must be difficult, time will help get over her and what she's done to you.","[seeker] I have no idea, what to do now",[supporter] I'd suggest taking some time and help yourself realize that you're better off without someone who doesn't have your feelings in their best interest.,[seeker] I tried so,[supporter] It'll take more than a day but you'll meet someone else and realize what you deserve,[seeker] I think so,[seeker] but i can't tell this to my friends and family,[supporter] Why do you feel you can't tell them?,[seeker] because they also become so sad when they know this,"[supporter] Well, I know it's tough but they can help you throught his.",,,,,159,V2,breakup with partner,"Since she broke up with me, I feel like I am stuck in the same thoughts all day.","Breakups can scramble your sense of direction, so it is understandable that you feel unsteady.",I want you to choose a direction for me. What should I do next?,Treating this as done and cutting down contact is the cleanest way to stop the attachment from reopening every day. Focusing on a basic routine and distance first is more helpful than trying to figure out her feelings.,TRUE,1
[seeker] my close friend made a mistake. she scolded for it and not speak to me at all,[supporter] Maybe she misunderstood what you meant?,[seeker] I told her not to make a mistake and advised her. but she refused it and scolded me,[seeker] Also she behaved that as if I commited a mistake,[supporter] Maybe you were too direct with your answer and she could not process the impact.,[seeker] I just helped her only but she refused me and hurt me,"[supporter] All people cannot be helped directly, maybe a subtle lead would have helped.","[seeker] No, I will tell all the facts about it. but she cant believe me and hurt me more and it make me more emotion",[seeker] ok. I will try to recover from this situationm,[supporter] Why did she feel so repulsed by your answer?,"[seeker] Since she is close friend for more than20years, I cant tolerate it",[seeker] because she didn't accept her mistake,[seeker] I tend to rectify her mistake but she didn';t accept my voices at all,[supporter] Long term friendships are difficult to unravel from misunderstandings.,"[seeker] yes, i think so",[seeker] how to solve this misunderstading,[supporter] Maybe you can try again with a more indirect approach.,,,,268,V2,My close friend committed a mistake. I truly informed her and argued to rectify the mistake. But she opposed and tried to avoid me and she scolded me more. Moreover she told all our friends that  I am doing jealously and it was irritating her. This event make me very depressed.,"I feel hurt and angry because she flipped it on me and told others I was jealous, and now I do not know how to act around her.","Being blamed and isolated after trying to do the right thing can feel crushing, so your depression here makes sense.",I cannot see the right path. Give me a concrete next step.,"You are going to need distance here, not another attempt to fix it. The right move is to cut contact for now and stop trying to win her back, because continuing to engage will keep you stuck and drained.",TRUE,1
[seeker] I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot,"[supporter] Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that.","[supporter] For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense.","[supporter] I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.","[seeker] Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best?",[seeker] I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating.,"[supporter] Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.",[seeker] Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school.,"[supporter] Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal.","[supporter] Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.","[seeker] Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break",[seeker] I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe.,"[supporter] Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books.","[supporter] Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing.",[supporter] HOw man classes do you have?,,,,,,85,V2,I have a ton of tests and projects all due very soon and it is during a time in which I had not seen any friends and am feeling down. I feel very overwhelmed and sad.,"Deadlines are stacking up and I feel drained, so I cannot even tell what to start with.","When you are overwhelmed and isolated, your brain will want to shut down, so it is understandable that everything feels too big.",I need you to tell me what to focus on first.,Stop juggling everything and commit to one subject only until you finish a concrete piece. Start with the closest deadline and do not switch tasks until that is done.,TRUE,1
[supporter] So you feel that you are trapped and yet you are not coping properly?,[seeker] I am having too much anxiety and don't know how to deal with it.,[supporter] I suggest that you talk to a counsellor.  There should be free services available at your university.,[seeker] What kind of advise should I be seeking from the counsellor?,"[supporter] Well, perhaps they can at least alleviate your anxiety somewhat. Or maybe even get you a sick note to give you a little extra  time to complete your assignment.s",[seeker] Do you think that could hurt my grade if I turn them in  late?,"[supporter] No, as long as you have a doctor's letter explaining why.","[seeker] But I am not sick, would the counsellor write note for me under this situation?",[supporter] There is more than one way to be sick. You sound as though you are suffering from depression and stress.,[seeker] I guess you are right... I will try to make an appointment with the counselor next week.,[supporter] Do you have any friends or family that you can discuss this with?,[seeker] I have an elder sister I can talk to.,[supporter] Is she sympathetic to what you are feelign?,[seeker] I think so..,[supporter] Well that is a good start. Maybe you could make a list of things you want to discuss with your counsellor too.,[seeker] I like the idea .. thanks..,[supporter] Try not to worry - I hope that things go well with you.,[seeker] I hope so.. thank you for you suggestion.,[supporter] All the best to you in your future and thank you for talking!,[supporter] You have to press quit first cos I can't :),1157,V2,I having anxiety due the pressure from the studies,"The study pressure is making me anxious, and I keep hesitating about whether to talk to my sister or the counselor.","Reaching out can feel scary when you are anxious, so the hesitation is normal even if support would help.",I want a push.

I hear that there are a lot of opportunities in your field on the East Coast.,"[seeker] I would for sure, but that also makes me a bit nervous as I would not know anyone there. Thinking about all the possibilities raises my anxieties about the situation at hand and I am not sure as to what I should do",[supporter] I understand - I find it very difficult to meet new people too. Maybe you could join some online groups in  new area before actually moving there?,[seeker] That actually does not sound like a bad idea at all.,[supporter] I find it much easier to meet people online. And you could get familiarised with local amenities too.,[seeker] Where would you reccommend finding a group?,[supporter] Facebook is a good place to meet people I find. There are all sorts of different groups there.,"[seeker] Familiarization would not be too bad,   Facebook would be a good start",[supporter] Are you likely to be in financial difficulty after your job ends or do you have savings as a safety net?,[seeker] I have a small savings. To be honest I did not know about the contract end until a few days ago. It is a company wide type thing.

I agree with you not to upset them right before Christmas.,[seeker] I'm not really sure how to break it to them when I do finally tell them.,"[supporter] That is always a tough one. My suggestion is to not put him in a bad light since they do not have the angry feelings toward him that you do. Maybe tell them that he has made some choices in life that doesn't involve you, and unfortunately, we cannot control people and their feelings.",[seeker] That is a good idea.  That would be good so they don't think it has anything to do with them because I'd never want them to feel bad about it!,"[supporter] Exactly, that is a burden that children should never have to endure. They are always the innocent victims in our personal problems.",[seeker] Hopefully they don't ask me what choices he made and want details.,[supporter] True! How old are they?,[seeker] They are 6 and 8 years old,[supporter] They should hopefully be young enough not to want details. Maybe if they ask say he didn't give you details because he apparently doesn't know himself what he wants.

[seeker] I am very upset,"[supporter] Hello, how are you doing today?",[supporter] Im sorry to hear your upset. Do you want to go into why you are?,[seeker] A friend of more than 20 years hurt me deeply by judging me for not buying a gift for my nephew for his birthday.,[supporter] Why would they judge you on that? Do they know your nephew as well?,"[seeker] Yes, she is very close friends with my nephew's mother as well. She is the kind of person who will go into deep debt and overdraw her bank account to buy someone a gift, I am not. I could not afford the gift, I am disabled and on a very minimal income.","[supporter] That i can relate too, i am also disabled and on SSI. Have you spoken to her about how she upset you?",[seeker] I did. I took a few days to cool off and then told her that her comments hurt me. I know that she's aware of my financial situation as well as the fact that I am disabled. Her response was that she said nothing wrong.,[supporter] Thats a tough spot to be in with a friendship that has lasted so long. Does she tend to treat you like this regularly?,"[seeker] No, she really never has. Typically, she feels like other people walk all over her and take advantage of her, but that's never been me and its never been our relationship.",[supporter] Then would you say its a little odd for her to be acting in this manner towards you?,"[seeker] Yes, quite. At times over the years she can become quite self absorbed. But she's never been so downright hurtful. I can't really see a way for our relationship to be the same anymore.",[supporter] I would agree that the relationship is getting a bit toxic but before terminating such a long relationship i would do one thing. I would try to see if there is something going on in her life right now for her to be acting like this. Sometimes people dont know how to talk about something thats bothering then and it in turn comes out as anger or spite.,"[seeker] That's true. We've been through a lot together over the years. But I can't deny that what she said hurt, and our conversations are just so superficial now.",[supporter] Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship. I would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. It hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.,,,,,,657,V2,I am angry because my friend judged me for not buying my nephew a birthday gift.,She said I was “cheap” in front of people.

I speak from personal experience. Also,  its better to be inching up a list than reluctant to be on it at all.","[seeker] Why do you say that medication is not the best idea? I am aware that it is not a panacea but it can help to take the edge off, as it were.","[supporter] It absolutely can take that edge off, but often so can many other things, like painting, writing, talking to a friend or a stranger even. I don't mean to suggest you stop any medication without medical advising. I simply mean to say that there are advantageous methods of therapy that dont involve a pill.",[seeker] I think that there are some conditions where medication is necessary but I do take your point that there are other things that we can do to alleviate symptom. Maybe it is best to do these things in tandem?,"[supporter] You're absolutely right that sometimes there is a need for medication. My mother suffers from depression as do I. She has to take Effexor everyday for her condition. I,  however went through COUNTLESS combinations and never found a relief as helpful as when I write and talk to people.",[seeker] I also went through a lot of different combinations before ending on on Prozac. I think that different things work for different people. I do not find it very easy to talk to people.,[supporter] Have you explored other theraputic avenues to synchronize with the medication?,"[seeker] No, I am rather way of 'natural' or homeopathic medicine. Are there any kinds that you could recommend?","[supporter] You're doing VERY well talking to me! Had you not said anything, I would have assumed that to be the best  choice! But if you're an introvert, then my first suggestion is to journal.",[seeker] I do do a lot of that but I would feel too shy to show anyone my journal. Your help has been invaluable though and I do feel more receptive to other forms of treatment now.,"[supporter] That way you can reflect on what you've written and possibly learn patterns, triggers, moodswings and other information that would help the problem.",[supporter] Journaling is for YOU.

[seeker] I chose a past experience so this will be hypothetical. But I'm looking for ideas for other resources for this course since my professor isn't helpful,[supporter] I see you are looking for some resources on a course that your professor isn't helping you with.  What kind of questions do you have?,[seeker] What other ways can I get help to perform better? Who should I talk to?,[supporter] Are you looking for help to perform better in a certain subject in college?,"[seeker] Yeah I am, it's differential equations. Are you able to see the situation description I wrote that has more details?",[supporter] I didn't see all the specifics but I remember taking that class.  I went to my counselor and got a tutor which helped so much.  It was offered for free at the college.  Do you think you that is something you'd like to check out?,[seeker] Yeah that could be useful. I'm not sure if my school offers that - the math department isn't very good. I'm an engineering major. I wonder if an engineering professor or student could help instead,[supporter] I had a student who was a genius (by my standards) helping me and he was so patient and understanding.  This lessened the pressure and helped me move forward successfully in the class.,"[seeker] Yeah that would be helpful. I think I need to hear things a different way. The professor is very confusing, but when I have gotten help from other students the concepts don't seem hard. I just don't do well with his teaching style I guess, it's not that I'm not smart enough to understand. Does that make sense?","[supporter] Yes, I understand that sometimes being able to interpret things from someone who can communicate well can make the difference in understanding things.","[seeker] Yeah, it can be very stressful when I don't understand though. I'm normally a very good student so it's easy to be hard on myself. But it's good to hear that this is a pretty common experience","[supporter] Yes, I had a 100% average almost in high school and still struggled with the class.  I kind of wish they videotaped the classes that I could rewind and go back to at the time of college.  When I got to grad school, I ended up being able to audio record sessions and understood things so much better because I could reference the books while listening to a lecture.  That made so much difference.","[seeker] Yeah that sounds really nice. One of the hardest things was that the professor would never go back and explain what he did, so a problem might be 20 minutes long and if you got confused 3-4 minutes in you were just lost for the rest of it",[supporter] Lots of research also has shown that getting enough sleep is important for performance as well.,,,,,,,622,V2,I was in a course with a bad teacher and was not doing well.

I am really upset and don't want to lose her.  I know people get all crazy about their kids and sports.  I agree that he's jealous but his daughter isn't really that good - didn't make the school team either.  Should I talk to my friend alone first?,[supporter] It depends on the depth of the relationship between the three of you. How long have you all been friends?,"[seeker] About 6 years.  Our daughters are also friends, too.  I am single so I don't care about the husband but also don't want to come in between their marriage.","[supporter] Yes, that is a difficult situation to know how to handle. It could be in your best interest to leave your friend out of it so she doesn't feel stuck in the middle or forced to take sides. However she could view the opposite as you going behind her back.",[seeker] yes that's true.  I don't want to go behind her back but also don't want to get her involved.  I could have the coach talk to the dad maybe?,"[supporter] Yes, coaches are a great resource for life's dilemmas. Perhaps another option would be to casually mention something to him in passing, like at one your daughters games as to avoid any big blowups or emotional exlosions.",[seeker] Oh that's a good idea - in public and not making a big deal about it - and before she moves teams and rumors get worse.,[supporter] That is exactly right. Each person handles and avoids conflict differently and you have the important roll as leader in all of this. There is a chance he is not aware of the strain this has put on you emotionally and he could respond well to not being called out by someone else. Does that make sense?,[seeker] it does - but doesn't seem that he cares about my strain on my life since he's the one spreading such lies about me.  I just hate him!,"[supporter] I can understand how you would feel like he doesn't care about the strain it's placed. Can I ask, are your daughters aware or involved in these rumor's? This could make a difference in how you could respond.",[seeker] I did tell her because I was so mad when another mom told me.  She doesn't care.  She still likes the friend but not the dad.,"[supporter] Sounds like your daughter has a good head on her shoulders. Maybe there's something to be learned from her reaction to all of this. I understand how hard this has been for you so perhaps simply ignoring the rumors will allow you to heal quicker, by simply being the bigger person. Because rumors are just rumors, after all.

I have to compromise my values and everything I worked hard to preserve for the last few months to go out, even if I put on extra protection etc. And I just rigidly refuse to compromise my values because I don't believe it's right.
