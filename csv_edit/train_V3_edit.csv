Yes, when I told my family that I wasn't coming, I stated health risks as the reason. But, I am worried that they may insist on me attending as we get closer to the holidays and in some ways I feel guilty because it isn't just the pandemic that makes me not want to go. I usually don't feel great during holidays with my family and I think they are harmful to me overall",[supporter] I understand how you feel. I'm currently saving up to move out myself because I think it would give me a chance to think for myself.,"[seeker] Yeah, I think people deserve to build whatever home, family, or environment is best for them and shouldn't be judged for it","[supporter] I don't think you should feel guilty about that because you are looking out for yourself which is the most important thing. And it always helps to voice your feelings to your family. Whether or not they choose to accept it, just getting things off your chest can help too.","[seeker] Yes, it made me feel powerful in some way to say no to going to holidays even if it was in the context of the pandemic",[seeker] Thank you for helping me.

[supporter] I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately?,[seeker] No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that's the same for everyone.,"[supporter] These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression?",[seeker] I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse.,[supporter] Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again?,"[seeker] Since lockdown  haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available?","[supporter] It wouldn't hurt to try and reach out. If she isn't available, there are other services.",[seeker] What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest.,"[supporter] Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app.",[seeker] I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays.,"[supporter] There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it's worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn't available. Sometimes its good to have options.",[seeker] I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues?,[supporter] After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn't until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it.,[seeker] That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways.

I feel like I have to drop my Master's because it all seems like too much.","[seeker] I have used those tools. With the current environment in the world, I feel like dealines are a waste of time. I'm trying to go with the flow and just set daily goals.","[supporter] I can see how this would be very overwhelming. I have a child learning virtually as well. Similarly, I am a student.

Virtual learning has affected our daily goals, though we are doing prerecorded lessons. That does make it easier I am sure. I have a 10 and 2 year old at home with me. One thing that has helped me is support groups. There are so many moms going through the same thing we are at this time.","[seeker] I never even thought of support groups. It would help to connect with other moms, just to remind myself that I am not alone in this. Thank you so much. You also have a busy bee on your hands!","[supporter] You are not alone in this. You could take the 3 year old to another room if possible and work on phonics/numbers, then help the older children during naptime.

I wonder how I can get through to him to really let him know I'm serious. Ideas?,"[supporter] I have been in the same situation myself, what I usually do is sit down with them and start the conversation in a serious mood.

Unfortunately we live on the same street so it's kind of hard not to run into each other. :/,"[supporter] That's even easier to make it clear, if you run into him, just give him a polite greetings. The point is, make it clear you have had enough","[seeker] Right, so basically let him know if he continues to act like he does, we're done as friends, correct? Or should I not be that bold?","[supporter] Yes. Be not too harsh at first. I would say to give him 1 more chance.

[supporter] Can you share the dilemma you are having?,"[seeker] Basically. This has happened for as long as I can remember, even back when I was a little kid.

They'll literally ignore me for months and randomly text me for money. If i respond theyll read my messages then ignore me until they need money again.

Me and the other girl got very close and then boom she randomly decided she only wants to talk to me when shes mad or bored,[supporter] So feel that this new couple might value the friendship with your husband more then you,[seeker] yeah it seems that way. Most people like him more than me and it's weird because he sucks at socializing and doesn't even like them that much,[seeker] It just doens't make sense but that's just the way the ca rds were dealt,[supporter] I used to have a hard time forming a meaningful relationship but then I realized it's because I had nothing in common with the people I was trying to form them with.
