She helps me pay my monthly bills too.,"[supporter] Yeah reach out to your mum, and although you fight and argue, they are still your family at the end of the day",[supporter] Thats nice of her :),"[seeker] Yes, that is a good point. I have always heard the blood is thicker than water.",[seeker] I have also been upset lately because I had to leave all my pets when I moved out. I left my dog and my cat back at home.,[supporter] Have you visited them ever since?,"[seeker] No, I am too far away to stop by or go for the weekend. I would have to plan a whole trip and I cant really afford it yet. My brother knew that the pets were mine but he demanded that he keep them there and I didnt want to fight with him so I said fine.",[supporter] If they are your pets you should be able to keep them but you did the right thing as to not argue with your brother and your parents could  help you look after them,"[seeker] Yeah, you are right. Once he let the gate open just so my dog would run away, he says he didn't do it but I know him and he is really mean and vengeful. He would also pull pranks on me that were just cruel. He once told me that my cat was ran over but he was just hiding her at a friends house for a week.","[supporter] Yeah, he doesn't seem very nice, but its good that you don't retaliate negatively","[seeker] Yeah, I used to be really depressed living there.

[supporter] It is sad indeed having a loved one past. Having time will help.,[seeker] Yes but how much time?,[supporter] Some takes weeks. Others take month or years. It's different for everyone. I know where you are coming from. I lost my husband a couple years ago and it took me awhile to move on as well.,"[seeker] I'm so sorry.  It is very hard, isn't it?  I know time is helping, but sometimes, like today, it's just overwhelming how much I miss him.","[supporter] I think perhaps you could think of the wonderful times that you spent with your fiance, and cherish those feelings.","[seeker] Yes, I do try.  Thank you.",[seeker] May I ask what helped you move forward?,[supporter] I thought of the good times that we spent together. What are some of your happy memories with your fiance?,"[seeker] Some of my favorites are playing games together or watching movies.  Curling up on the couch. He had kidney failure, so we didn't do much outside, but spent as much time together as we could. He used to call me his sunshiney baby doll.  Whenever I see sunflowers I think of him.","[seeker] But most of all, it was that he loved me.  He loved me for me ... he didn't want me to be anyone or anything else. That was a miracle.",[supporter] That is so sweet. How are you feeling now with all these memories coming back to you?,"[seeker] actually i am feeling somewhat better.  still sad, but it's good to remember those things.  thank you.",[seeker] i appreciate your time and understanding.  I hope you are able to remember your good times as well.,"[supporter] Other ways to cope is perhaps taking a new hobby. Do you have any new interest that you would like to try? I took up a cooking class a few months after my husband past away, and I really enjoyed it.",[seeker] i've been trying to figure out a hobby ... but i haven't really found anything that appeals to me.  a cooking class sounds interesting though. i might learn how to do things in the kitchen without injuring myself.,[seeker] I tend to be clumsy at the best of times and have done things such as (most recently) dropping a scalding bowl of chili on my foot.  I tend to wait to do new things til the last injury heals.,[supporter] I think you will do fine in the kitchen once you get the hang of it. What are some of your favorite food?,,,,724,V5,It is the anniversary of my fiance's death.

[supporter] Robin Williams talked about that situation.,[supporter] He said that he didn't fear being alone as much as being with people that he didn't like.,"[seeker] Did he really? Well, it's sad how he ended up, I'm too scared to commit suicide like he did! I enjoy living life, even when I have months at a time without human connection","[supporter] Adult entertainers provide one kind of companionship, but it is not complete. It feels like a stopgap to me. Is it fulfilling enough for you?","[seeker] You're right, I just lack self confidence in my poetry....hopefully I'll figure out a way to spit it out on a blog or something","[supporter] You could trade poems with other budding poets. ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours.""",[supporter] Do you find yourself to be more an introvert or an extrovert?,[seeker] Oh it's been very fulfilling for me when I've had the opportunity to use it. Most of them are genuine women. Only a handful have tried to take advantage of me.,[seeker] I'm definitely an extrovert,[seeker] That was a clever pun by the way,[seeker] It's ironic and strange how many people struggle with that stupid voice in their head that tells them they're not good enough to accomplish anything.,"[supporter] Thanks. Ok. The pandemic is particularly hard on extroverts. People look down on sex workers, but I think that the world is a big complex place and people are trying to make their way in it. If everyone is consenting, I see no problem.","[supporter] Have you tried psilocybin? Some people swear that it changes the inner monologue for the better. I am not a physician, but for long-term adjustment, it might be beneficial.","[seeker] Well of course it's consentual. I would never NOT ask for permission to do things with a sex worker, or any person.","[seeker] I'll have to Google that, I've never heard of that, but thanks for the advice!",[supporter] Sure! I'm glad we had a chance to chat. Best of luck with making friends/girlfriends after the pandemic!,"[supporter] BTW, is there a quit button on your end?",,,,1103,V5,I wish I had a girlfriend.
