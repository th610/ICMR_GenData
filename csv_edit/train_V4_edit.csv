"[seeker] I am glad you are doing okay, I am struggling with my current employer which has brought me an area of anger and sadness.","[supporter] Oh no, that's not good. I understand how you feel there. I can definately relate to that...What's going on?","[seeker] My employer is great, I work for a local hospital as a house keeper technician, but my department is poorly observed by HR and corporate. I have been excelling in my role and went from part time employee with no benefits at 40hrs a week, but since I have a applied for our security team I was denied because I took the full time position and have to wait another 4 months. I have already worked in this position for 7 months.",[supporter] So you applied for the Security Team and was denied because of your full time position with the same company?,"[seeker] Correct, when I took the position my manager said that I could transfer after six months. I felt lied to and the micromanaging and high turn overstaff due to my supervisor has me on that same boat now. I feel like my only option is to quit. HR was the one who delivered the transfer denial.","[supporter] Wow, that is crazy that is going on, it doesn't seem fair at all...",[supporter] Have you tried going to any higher up? Perhaps in the HR department?,"[seeker] I am thoroughly disappointed, I have applied for a few local security job sites in my area that have had some interest in my resume. I figure I will leave the hospital since I was lied and I can only see this being the trend with this department. They keep their good workers and let the low skilled workers transfer out or they just quit.","[supporter] That's horrible they would treat the HOSPITAL workers like this, with everything that is going on in the world today.",[seeker] I have a six page paper of grievances for HR and a full unscripted transparent experience as an employer with details and dates of these frustrations. I know it will not go anywhere since their policy states that an employee must work six months from when they take a new position within the company. I went from a housekeep to a housekeeper technician (scrub walls and take curtains down and clean contact rooms).,[supporter] That is a position right there in the line of fire.,[supporter] Have you tried for employment anywhere else? I wouldn't just quit and not have something else at least working in the background.,"[seeker] I am paid $10.75 an hour and their security team makes about $12.50 plus overtime opportunities and details. I went to school for criminal justice and the hospital would have helped me obtain my bachelors if I worked for them after completing it, I had to work there for a year in order to get their help. I was looking forward to this opportunity, but now I am just to bitter to work there at this point.  I loved what we stand for value wise, but   their values are not walked out","[seeker] I have an interview soon with another company that I am just waiting on the details for, I think this will yield more fruit once I get the approval. I am uncertain if I will give two weeks if I can do a ""start today"" option.",[supporter] I definitely understand that. Do you want a couple links on dealing with some stress? I personally like to run..,"[seeker] Sure links are always helpful (for the record, I left the employer and work for fabulous healthcare company now that I have been with for two years). Do you run during the winter when it is cold, or do you have different coping strategies for the winter time. It is 8 degrees where I am at.",[supporter] I live in Georgia so yes i so run every morning...Great stress reliever,,,,70,V4,I am unable to work at my job anymore due to a poor supervisor who made my work much more difficult.,"Lately, it feels like I can’t seem to find a workplace where I’m truly valued.

Like don't be to happy because things are going to fail,"[supporter] Its hard to stop those negative thoughts, but the first step is sharing your feelings with others and talking about it.  You are now on your way to healing.",[seeker] It does help to talk about it with someone who doesn't judge,[supporter] I can see in your words how stressed you are and troubled.,[seeker] This whole covid thing makes it 10 times worse,[supporter] May I suggest that you seek some face to face support from a best friend or close family member.,[seeker] easier said then done I'm high risk so I have been social distancing,"[supporter] Its still possible.

[supporter] \So you have had a breakup recently and you are feeling down about it,[seeker] Yes. I thought that it wouldn't be terrible because I initiated it but now I regret it,[supporter] So are you doubting that you made the right decision or are you just feeling sadness at the loss you are feeling right now,[seeker] I'm mainly doubting my decision and I know there's nothing I can do about it,[supporter] You must have had good reason's to have made the decision to breakup and to have initiated it.  Its normal to doubt yourself afterwards.  You may want to remind yourself of the reasons that you came to your decision you did.  Im sure the reasons are still valid,"[seeker] I did it because I'm trying to focus on self-improvement but looking back now, there's no reason I couldn't have improved myself with my partner",[supporter] So you felt the need to have some time to fucus on your own goals and growth and now you feel like you could have stayed in the relationship and you are doubting that you needed to take the step of breaking up.  In my experience at times we need to be single for self growth and I have found that personal growth usual thrives when I am single.,"[seeker] That's what I hope for. I just can't get over missing my partner because they were great to me, I just needed to be alone.",[supporter] I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing.  I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more.  You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time,[seeker] I did get the chance to explain my reasons a few days after the breakup. We were friendly and talked casually for a few more days and then they said they needed to space to get themselves together. We haven't really talked since then. The problem is I'm open to something in the future but I don't know that they are and I can't find the courage to ask,[supporter] I have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with.  I think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won't be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon,[seeker] I think I can do that. They needed space because it was hard going from being in a relationship to being friends in a matter of days. I guess I'll just have to continue working on myself and see how things go,[supporter] Focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do. Start on that list of self improvements you want to make.  Connect with friends you may have lost touch with.  Your going to be great,,,,,,,,791,V4,I recently split up with my boyfriend and I am regretting it.,"If this relationship ends, I feel like everything meaningful in my life will disappear.","When so much meaning is invested in one person, separation can feel like losing the foundation that holds everything together.",I don’t think I’d ever feel happy again without them.,"From where you are emotionally, it may truly feel as though happiness and that relationship are inseparable.",TRUE

One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?",[seeker] In about a month.,"[supporter] I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.",[supporter] Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?,"[seeker] Yes, but I've been really bad about keeping her in the loop. I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her.","[supporter] Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track.","[supporter] Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.",[seeker] That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper.,"[supporter] It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week.","[supporter] Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.",,,,,,,,86,V4,"I have been procrastinating on my senior thesis, and the pending deadline is making me extremely nervous and on-edge.","Lately, I’ve been feeling like there’s no way I’ll finish my thesis on time.

I don't want to get fired.",[supporter] Asking for help isn't always a bad thing.  I asked for help at my last job and they gave me someone to help out.  I was so relieved.,[seeker] That's true maybe it could turn out for the better.  But what if they see me as incompetant?,"[supporter] I can see that you have worry of being seen incompetent but as long as you are doing your best, they have to see the efforts you are making as positive.",[seeker] That's a good way to put it.,[supporter] Sometimes deep breaths can help keep you calm when approaching others in an anxiety provoking situation.,[seeker] I will have to try that.  That might help.,[supporter] Have you thought of doing additional work related trainings?  Sometimes they can give suggestions to improve work abilities.,[seeker] That sounds great.  Do you think my work would be supportive?,[supporter] Work can often pay for trainings or offer suggestions what may improve work strategies.,"[seeker] Wow, I hope I can take advantage of that.  I will have to check into that.  Who should I approach at work?",[supporter] You could ask your immediate supervisor or sometimes Human resources for support.,[seeker] I can do that.  I think I'll reach out tomorrow to Human Resources for some help.,[supporter] That sounds like a good plan to reach out for support.

And their help isn't always the best, or the type of support I am looking for.",[supporter] I can see how that would be difficult.,"[supporter] Maybe if there is something specific  you need help with, you could ask a coworker or senior staff.","[seeker] Yeah, it has been very difficult. Do you have any reccomendations? Or what would you do in the situation?","[seeker] I generally do do that. Sometimes I get the help I need, others not so much.

Do you have any suggestions for what I can do to try and do better in my classes? I've tried talking to my professors, but they've all been really unhelpful thus far","[supporter] Of course! I like to wake up a little earlier and at least get started on an assignment to feel like I have accomplished something at least before the rest of the world wakes up. I understand some people like their sleep, so another suggestion is to review any notes you take and use different colored ink for different topics or important highlights","[seeker] I think that's a really good idea! I usually sleep in too late and then feel like I'm rushing around to get all of my work done, only adding onto the stress. I also really like the pen idea. Do you have any suggestions for good brands that I should use to help make my notes better?","[supporter] Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure.","[seeker] I think that's a really good idea for helping to improve my focus.

I think your suggestion of waking up earlier is good too, what time do you suggest waking up in the morning? I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class","[supporter] I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army.  But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :)","[seeker] I think that would really help. I sometimes have trouble waking up to my alarms in the morning too, but maybe making the ringtone louder would help with that as well or putting it further away from me so that I have to get up further in the morning to get it. Do you think those would be effective too? Or would getting a different alarm help?","[supporter] That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.","[seeker] Ooh, yeah. I like your ringtone idea too! I usually make it some sort of song that I like and then end up either sleeping past it or not hearing, but I think making it something loud or annoying would really help to get me up to turn it off.","[supporter] What exactly do you think causes you to have to rush around before class?

"[seeker] I had been seeing a therapist online and two weeks ago he was really mean, but said he thought it was a good session and we were making a breakthrough. Then when I signed on last week I signed in to request entrance into the meeting and after a few moments was told it was denied. Nothing like feeling the person who is paid to help you refusing to talk to you",[supporter] That seems like a frustrating experience.

Up to that point we mostly just talked about politics or whatever. I'm a charity patient, he get's paid through the organization, but because of my financial difficulties, I'm not paying. I think he saw that as a shortcoming on my part.","[supporter] I think that is definitely one way to look at it. But another way to look at your situation is you figured out a therapist who isn't worth seeing. That brings you one step closer to finding one who does actually help you. All you need to do now, is do some research and find someone who has your best interest in mind. Believe me, there are great therapists and terrible therapists. You just need to find one of the good ones now.",[seeker] I'm not sure I can find another who I don't have to pay.

I guess I just have to find another way to cope,"[supporter] If you have financial issues and you need the help from a therapist you deserve the treatment. One thing you can do is apply for Medicaid and EBT. The state you live in will give you money to pay for groceries and to get help from a therapist for free if you don't have a high enough income. It may be worth looking into because all you really need to do is fill out some forms and likely you will be approved.

What are some of the coping strategies you've been practicing with your prior therapist?,"[seeker] I asked him to help me with some but all he would say is that I should stop vaping (I switched from smoking some years ago). I told him it feels like I'm walking a tightrope and he's suggesting I get rid of the safety net without giving me something else, some other way to cope. He said that's not what a therapist is supposed to do and that my resistance shows I don't really want to change.","[supporter] I can see how that comment he made would be frustrating. If you feel like vaping, you should continue to do; however, what happens if say you go somewhere and find yourself in a stressful position? What would be strategy you could use in order to recenter yourself? Strategies are important as they balance us when we experience stressors that through us off.
