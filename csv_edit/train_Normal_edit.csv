I keep my legs bent and put a pillow under my knees for support. I then put one hand on my chest and one on my diaphram and slowly breathe through my nose feeling my stomach press against my hand. I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.,"[seeker] Okay, I will give that a try.

I don't see how I sit in meetings or how I smile when I'm thinking to be constructive work based feedback it's really frustrating it's clear this person just doesn't like me,[supporter] Going to another manager may be a great idea! Maybe the manager could address the issue with her and help her to realize there is nothing wrong with a having happy employee like yourself.,[seeker] yeah that's true I mean I'm almost thinking this manager needs to be retrained because this video isn't work related is really quite petty an actually makes me consider not working for her in future.

We try to stay positive, but it is hard when nothing changes.","Staying positive is tough when the situation keeps repeating. It may help to focus on one practical step at a time, like calling for clarification, reviewing the denial reason, or getting help from a local assistance office.

He seems to have traded midwestern charm for NYC bullying.,[supporter] Maybe he should start seeing a therapist every day maybe that will help,"[seeker] I am not sure that he can afford that, but I have seen small changes in his behavior since he started seeing her. I want him to stop seeing my boyfriend as the enemy.",[supporter] maybe your boyfriend and your son needs to sit down and have a talk,[seeker] That may work with a therapist.

"[supporter] Good afternoon, what can I help you with today?","[seeker] Hi, I'm just wanting to talk about my sadness that happens every now and then. Sometimes at night, (and only at night) I get in these super depressive moods and have almost mental breakdowns about everything in my life. But it doesn't happen all the time... only sometime and I don't know why","[supporter] That sounds like a really difficult situation to be in, I'm sorry to hear you're going through that.","[seeker] Yeah it is, and I'm not sure why it happens","[supporter] Especially when the sun starts going down sooner, it can seem like we have less time, and as if things are closing in upon us.","[seeker] Yeah exactly. Where I live, we just had daylight savings so it gets dark around 5:30 PM and it feels like my days are just wasted","[supporter] There are a few strategies you could use to combat that.  Personally, I try to soak in as much sunlight as possible before it goes down.  Sometimes that will mean moving your work space, maybe getting up earlier to have a cup of coffee in the sunrise, maybe it's scheduling breaks into your day where you specifically get some vitamin D.","[supporter] As far as the intrusive and repetitive nature of the thoughts, have you ever consulted with a therapist or other mental health professional?  Obsessive thoughts are sometimes a sign of anxiety.","[seeker] Yeah that is good advice. I definitely need to work on getting myself up earlier in the mornings, I've just come so accustomed to my current sleep schedule.","[seeker] And in all honesty, I haven't tried a therapist yet... I'm scared it will be hard to open up to a stranger",[supporter] That's an understandable fear.,[supporter] I challenge you to think about it as not too different from this chat here;  An opportunity to get some objective advice and perspective.,[seeker] Wow yeah I didn't even really think about that... And I'm sure there are ways to get in contact with therapists without having to be face to face? I just like the anonymous aspect of it. I feel like I come across as weak if people see me for me,"[supporter] Yes, BetterHelp is one of those I believe",[supporter] TalkSpace is another one,[seeker] Yeah that's true I have heard of BetterHelp. Maybe I should reach out on one of those platforms when  I feel like I am going into one of my depressive episodes.,"[supporter] It may be helpful!  As far as I understand it's exceptionally easy to switch between therapists on that service, too.  So if the first one is not a good fit, you can try someone else.","[supporter] The biggest piece of advice that I can give you is some that I've recently been enacting for myself:  When you get into the spiral, and you can't shake the nasty repeated thoughts, even if you ""need"" to sleep, get out of bed and move to a different room.  Change the situation up, get some tea, sparkling water, whatever you want, but change what your body is literally doing.",,,750,Normal,"Every few nights at nighttime, I get severely depressed and I don't know why",At night I replay my day and my mind zooms in on everything I did wrong.

They are both adults, I hope even with tension, they don't do anything inappropriate, do they?","[seeker] Well, the ex has gotten in the wife's face once or twice, but that's simmered down some.

If it's too much, have you and your wife considered moving away?","[seeker] Oh I can't imagine ever moving.  We have a pretty terrific house.   Plus I bought most of the neighboring houses over the years, so now it's kind of a whole compound.   I don't know that there's any particular fix for this, it's just sort of something to live with I think.","[supporter] I understand, you're in a very tough spot. Have your wife ever expressed her annoyance?",[seeker] Oh a little bit.  She's only mildly weirded out by the whole thing.   It's a shame the ex has to be kind of problematic about everything.   I mean otherwise we could all still hang out and whatnot,"[supporter] That's not too bad then. Your wife seems to be mature and understanding. If you can't do anything to completely avoid your ex, maybe your best choice is to limit seeing her as much as possible",[seeker] That's pretty good advice I'd say!,[supporter] You and your wife can hang out a bit further from your home. It's inconvenient but at least your time won't be interrupted by your ex,"[seeker] Yes, that's a possibility as well I suppose.","[seeker] I think we're allowed to wrap this up at this point, if you like?",[seeker] Still with me?,[seeker] yooo hooo,[supporter] I'm here,[supporter] Of course if you think you're good with my advice,"[seeker] oh ok, I think we need to chat a bit more in order to wrap things up","[supporter] Sure, is there anything else I can help you with?",562,Normal,"My wife and I had a threeway with my ex, and they're kind of at each other's throats now.

I do not know what I did wrong.,"[supporter] You did nothing wrong. It's something wrong with him, if he did this to you, he'll probably do it again to her. Do you really want to be with someone that disregards your well being like that?","[seeker] That is a very sensible way to look at things .. I do rationally realise that.

From a practical standpoint, have you tried to reach out to people you can trust in your personal and professional network to see whether there are opportunities for work?",[seeker] That is a really good suggestion I have tried agencies but not actually made a concerted effort with my network.

"[supporter] I am sorry to hear that. So, you and your friends are not seeing eye to eye? Do you mind telling me what the issue is that yo are not agreeing on?",[seeker] I explained my personal problems but they are not giving proper response,[supporter] That can be difficult and I can relate to that too. When friends do not respond the way that we feel that they should it can be really hard. Do you have any family that you are close with?,"[seeker] They need more money from me, but i couldn't  give  that much amount",[supporter] I understand the issue of money can cause a lot of problems in a relationship. I had a best friend borrow money once and it lead to her never paying it back and we stopped being friends. Do you plan on trying to talk to your friends soon? Maybe I can give you some advice on how to approach them.,[seeker] I want to speak with them because they are in good nature,"[supporter] Maybe you could chose a place to meet that is neutral, somewhere at a park or at a cafe. You can ask them to reflect on the good memories in your friendship and then express how you value them as people and friends. Does that sound like something you can try?","[seeker] Yes, i want to do some moderate friendship with them",[supporter] That is a good idea too. Having boundaries is the healthiest part of a relationship so that neither party gets taken advantage of. Setting up lines not to cross is a great idea.,[seeker] I want to do some help to them but i don't do expect more from them,[supporter] I understand that friends can disappoint us sometimes and friendships can take a lot of effort.

"[supporter] Also, setting clear boundaries for your study/work and relax times may help.  I like to set a timer for, say, 45 minutes, and work/write/read/study for that long, then, I get a 10 minute break.  I'll go outside, refresh my coffee, grab a snack, dance to some music, stretch, then set another timer for 45 minutes, then another break for 10 minutes.  That allows my brain to take a second and refresh from the work.","[seeker] That is actually very helpful, I'll take note of it",[seeker] I think it would help to fix break times so I can actually focus on working,"[supporter] Or, like, today, I woke up and spent half an hour allowing myself to drink my coffee and scroll through Reddit.  Then it was time to work on my group project for 45 minutes, then a break, then I worked again, took a break, went to a class, etc.  Scheduling your breaks can be helpful too so your lizard brain doesn't freak out and go ""WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING FOREVERRRR""","[seeker] I agree!!! That really is helpful, thank you","[supporter] which, for me at least, is where the fatigue sets in.  You're very welcome!  I hope I was helpful.

I'm just feeling very sad about it.",[supporter] An uptick in expenses seems to be an issue for a lot of us right now.  Glad to hear you enjoy your job.  Sounds like you are a bit torn about leaving a great company.  Do I understand that right?,[seeker] That's right. It's hard to know what to do.,[supporter] I can absolutely understand why your situation is difficult.  Have you had a chance to talk with your manager about another opportunity within the company that provides higher compensation?,"[seeker] I've considered it, but I unfortunately work for a non-profit and the likelihood of them being able to offer another opportunity is pretty low. Do you think it would still be worth it to ask?",[supporter] That's fantastic that you work for a non-profit.  I've been looking to transition to an opportunity like that sometime in the future.  It must be so fulfilling.  I think asking would be a great first step.,[seeker] It's really nice to have mission driven work and would definitely recommend it. It's unfortunate that it's challenging for many non-profits to pay as much as they should. Thank you for the advice! I'm really hoping I don't have to leave.,"[supporter] As a secondary plan, have you had the chance to look at positions with similar non-profits?","[seeker] I have searched around a bit, but have come to find that there's not many similar non-profits where I live currently. I may consider relocating if it's the right job, but that's a lot of additional stress.","[supporter] Additional stress right now certainly isn't anything anyone needs.  You may want to consider looking at resources online that provide comparable salary information for your position.  That would help with having a conversation with your current employer if you are being paid less than average.  Since they are a non-profit, I'm sure they would want to do everything to help you with your financial situation.",[seeker] That's a great idea - I have done some research but just kind of assumed most non-profits would be in the same boat. I'll do some looking around to see what I can find,[supporter] That sounds like a great next step.  Is there anything else on your mind that you'd like to chat about?,[seeker] That was all for today.

Have you tried any of these techniques?,[seeker] That sounds like it could help.  Maybe I could even try yoga.,"[supporter] Yes, that sounds like a great idea. I think yoga can be very beneficial in managing stress.",[seeker] Do you have any other suggestions for those busy days when I am non-stop?,[supporter] I think it is important to remember to take care of yourself. That means eating right and exercising. I found from my own experience of going through a stressful situation that exercise was the best technique for managing stress.,[seeker] Maybe I can get my friends to go for an early morning walk before I start the pressures of the day.  That might work to help me stay calmer.,[supporter] I understand that there are days where it feels non stop and it can be hard to find the time. Excercising early in the morning is a great idea because it gets you off to a good start to the day. I like the idea of including friends too.

It's hard to be perfect, but these programs are demanding.","[supporter] Indeed it is hard to be perfect and no one is. It sounds as though you are very hard on yourself.

That has helped in the past, so I think perhaps they could give me some guidance as well.",[supporter] You're welcome.

Is there an anonymous system for filing complaints?","[seeker] No, the company hasn't set up a system for passing along info that way. I don't know if she has talked to HR.

I think a lot of people are going through these days.,[seeker] It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade,[supporter] I'm sorry to hear that.

Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock?,"[seeker] Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade.",[supporter] And the teacher wouldn't budge?,"[seeker] Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me",[supporter] Was this for a course that was required for a major?,[seeker] It was a core class and I needed it to graduate,"[supporter] Ok, if you're willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn't work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it's offered.",[seeker] That does sound like a good idea. I am just so disappointed I'm not sure if it is worth it.,[supporter] I know what you mean. I failed a Calc class once and I felt so empty inside.

That way, we can help each other out.","A study group can be a real advantage if it’s structured. You could set a simple rule: meet weekly, pick 10–15 problems/topics, and each person explains one piece. Also add one support channel—office hours or tutoring—so you’re not relying on the group alone. What was the hardest part last time: concepts, practice, or test anxiety.",TRUE

Zoom and Facetime are my best friends right now.  lol I think that's one of the reasons why I snapped out of my depression is because I started doing that more since we couldn't go out and do anything.,[seeker] Ok that's interesting so you have also suffered with depression in the past? exactly how did you get out of it yourself?,[supporter] I downloaded Zoom around the end of May.  The first two months were the worst. I had never heard of Zoom until a friend said we should have a virtual party so he organized it and there were 11 on the call.  It was so much fun despite the fact.,"[supporter] Maybe organizing a ""zoom party"" would start to lift your spirits.",[seeker] that's a really good suggestion. I could also catch up with friends that haven't seen for a while. I think this would definitely work to boost my mood. The only problem is being depressed isn't something that I'm familiar with. what if it goes a little bit deeper than this?,"[supporter] Depression sucks I have to say!  Just don't let it win.  Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.","[seeker] Sure, or something conversations like this help perhaps a support group would be a good idea also?","[supporter] Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do.  Music, tv and books does it for me - and zoom",[supporter] Most definitely.

She's pretty sharp.,"[supporter] Well maybe you should address these feelings with her in a very relaxed public atmosphere.  Just let her know that you really like her and you have realized that she has many of the qualities that you look for in a person to get serious with.  However, you treasure your friendship more than anything and you do not want anything to come in between your friendship....this way you have addressed your feelings, she knows how you feel and then should she decide to every take the friendship to the next step, she wouldn't feel awkward.",[seeker] That sounds like a good plan.

I have taken a large income hit and also I'm having trouble finding someone who wants to actually go do something.",[supporter] Yes the Corona virus has really put a damper on all kinds of normal activities.  Have you thought about joining like a group with similar interests as yourself?  Maybe look for a local group that has a Facebook page and you can  start with building friendships just by chatting online or even on the public page itself.  Some of the best lasting relationships start out as friends with similar interests and then they blossom.,[seeker] I think I'll give that a try.

You can combine it with one concrete example and one clear request: “When you’re drinking, politics gets harsh—can we agree to avoid that topic or pause if it starts escalating.” If he reacts poorly, that also gives you information about what boundaries you need.",TRUE

What are you seeking support for today?",[seeker] I have been struggling for motivation to do anything the past couple weeks.  This is a really hard time of year for me.  I lost my cousin in a car accident at the age of 14 in a car accident coming up on 20 years this year.  We were very close.  I was 17 at the time.  Her was an alcoholic and my parents raised her a majority of her life.  Then 3 years ago 5 days after her death anniversary I lost my boyfriend at the age of 32 in a car accident.  I dread the holidays.,[supporter] Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you are describing a strong association between the holiday season and loss of loved ones. This leads to less of a desire to engage in typical holiday events. Does that sound right?,[seeker] You are exactly right.  The year my cousin got killed her mom was hungover so I went and picked up my cousin and her little brother to take them to our grandparents house for Christmas dinner.  She died 4 days later on Dec 29th.  And my boyfriend it was his first day back to work after the New Year.  He died on Jan 3rd.,[seeker] I usually go all out for the holidays to try to hide my depression every year.  This year I just can't bring myself to enjoy them.  I have even bought one christmas present.,"[supporter] I can see why this time of year is difficult for you. Trying to hide depression can be a challenge. Rather than hiding the sadness or grieving feelings, some people find relief in acknowledging and sharing these feelings with family members who may relate. Do you ever share these feelings with your cousin or grandparents that you mentioned?",[seeker] My cousin doesn't live around here and we have never been real close.  He is alot younger than me.  We just never had the connection like his sister and I did.  And both my grandparents have passed away.  Grandpa has been gone for 12 years and Grandma has been gone for 4 now.,[seeker] My family has always been really good about talking about our loses. Things just will never be the same.,[supporter] I understand. When losses are experienced it is a great change in many aspects of our lives.,"[supporter] Are there any aspects of the holidays that bring you joy? Maybe holiday music, movies, bright snow (if there is snow where you live), or seeing joy on someone's face when you give them a great gift?",[seeker] They say it gets easier. And I agree it does.  Things just have changed so much.  I miss how life was before I lost them.,"[supporter] I understand - and it is normal to feel that way.

I struggle around the holidays even worse now than I  did before.,I’ve been thinking about how my boyfriend used to love this season—decorating and making it feel special.,"Those dates carry layered grief, so it makes sense the holidays feel heavier than other times. When you remember him decorating, does it bring comfort, or does it sharpen the loss.","I feel a mix of happiness and sadness. I cherish those memories, but they also remind me of what I'm missing now.","That mix is a very human response.

But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious.","[seeker] that's a good thought, I wonder what he'd do if I stayed with a friend","[supporter] I wish I could fix this, but I can't. The road will be rocky and I don't know how I would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so I'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet.",[seeker] hey may not realize I'd leave at all,"[seeker] me too, that's making all the difference","[supporter] My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that.",[seeker] definitely that makes sense,"[supporter] He feared I would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, I have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do.

When you picture his reaction, are you mainly worried about emotional blowups, financial retaliation, or physical safety.","I just feel stuck between wanting to do what's best for me and the kids, but also worrying about his response.","That stuck feeling is understandable. A safer path is usually planning quietly: gather documents, understand finances, identify trusted support, and talk to a legal/advocacy resource if available. You deserve a plan that protects you and the children. Do you feel physically safe at home right now, and do you have a private way to reach support if needed.",TRUE

I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions.","[supporter] Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.","[seeker] Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products.","[seeker] I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract.

As we've gotten older it seems like our family has gotten split apart a bit more and everyone is too stressed and hurried to enjoy the old things that we used to do.

[supporter] I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant.

[seeker] I am doing well. My marijuana consumption today has been less than what it has been for the last week.,[supporter] Well that is good. Are you trying to come off it completely?,"[seeker] Absolutely not. I'm not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It's just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana","[supporter] Well, do you worry about your consumption? If you don't I don't see it as a problem :)","[seeker] Yes, because of the financial strain it places on me and my wife, who is also a regular user.","[supporter] Ah yes, it is not cheap.

It's sort of a grey area ... police won't really do anything but you can't buy it over the counter,[seeker] One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I'm very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially.,[supporter] Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot.

Mayoral elections were today yeah?",[supporter] They were but I didn't pay much attention :) I vote in the Generals and the locals but that's all .,"[seeker] Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that. I think participation in local governance is actually the most achievable path for change, but perhaps how it's structured where you are, it wouldn't really matter much if you participated.","[seeker] I guess mayorals are only technically local, not like parliamentary elections",[supporter] If I were in London or a major city I'd vote for Mayor. I am in a rural area and we don't have one :D. I vote for local councillors tho,"[seeker] Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti-Khan?

I have only called her severally, sent her message via whatsapp and facebook.","[supporter] It might be an option.  Maybe just lay out how you feel in it, and just ask her for an explanation perhaps.  It might be good to let her know that ""I understand it's over, but could you help me understand why so that I can close this chapter"" - perhaps she would respond to something like that.  If she doesn't, then you are going to have to make some hard decisions and try to process this.","[supporter] It's a very hard position to be in, but life is too beautiful to be miserable, and I know you would rather be happy.",[seeker] Sure i also want to be happy but we have shared so much in common and were in process of starting something good to help generate income. She had the idea and i had the capital. I feel this will really be a wasted opprtunity,[seeker] Is there anything else i can do to salvage the situation?,"[supporter] You are going to have to lay it all on the line with her, but be prepared for her to not respond in the way that you want.  Sometimes we do the best we can, and it still doesn't change the situation.

You could set a weekly target for applications and networking and also choose an evening cutoff time so the worry does not take over. What kind of role would you pursue if you needed to move?,TRUE

I eventually let go of what my family thought and pursued a career I would truly enjoy for myself.","[seeker] I wish I were in your shoes! If I change majors now, I have to redo at least a year of school, maybe more. I don't think my parents want to pay for that.",[supporter] Personally I took three years longer than it should to get my degree and accrued some debt because of it.

Is the regret about the major itself, burnout from workload, or feeling you chose it for someone else?",I need space but stepping away feels scary,"You do not have to decide blindly.

[seeker] thank you i've done the research to dispute my parents' arguments you see,[seeker] but like-,[seeker] utimately its about how much i like it o not,[seeker] *or,"[supporter] i think what you need to do is take that same logical approach and explain calmly to your parents the path you want to take. just because they think your strengths are suited for architecture, doesnt mean you don't also have the strengths for engineering. many of the same skills are probably required for both jobs, and you're right: ultimately it is about what will make you happy",[supporter] and worst case scenario: you can always change careers later if you find that you don't like what you're doing,[seeker] yeah you are absolutely right,[seeker] but about the careers path,"[seeker] not sure if you're in canada or not, but it's much harder to switch careers in canada",[seeker] you pay more and it's not like in the States where you can finish your degree whenever you want right,[seeker] once you paid,"[supporter] you sound like a good student and i'm sure your parents must recognize that you're capable of great things, so if you can present to them a logical argument of why you feel engineering is a better path, hopefully they will listen.",[seeker] yeah that is the plan,[seeker] you're been extremely helpful and im grateful for that,[seeker] i don't get to share these things very often,[seeker] my friends are just as busy too you see,[seeker] But I'll think we can stop it here,[supporter] you're welcome. best of luck to you and i hope you find the right path for yourself. i commend you for opening up here and i think you'll find success,,,511,Normal,My parents are making me going into a career path that I don't like,Lately I have been thinking about how to talk to them about engineering,"That is a hard position to be in. What do you think they value most, stability, income, status, or safety?",They were surprised and hesitant because they do not know engineering well,"If they do not know the field, showing a clear plan helps, what engineers do, career paths, and steps you will take like projects or internships.

Is this true for you?","[seeker] No I am stuck going into work, we are essential enough to stay open","[supporter] Ah, I also know some essential workers who must physically attend work.

Olympic size pool. Keep praying. the job is yours.,"[seeker] Because my job is to sell repeat business, it is essential that I get out and meet guests and make certain that their needs are met, but it usually comes in the form of serving snacks at intermission and saying hellos as one passes.

[supporter] So this is a close friend,"[seeker] Yes, we have been friends for 10 years, best friends",[supporter] That could cause a sadness,[seeker] Absolutely...what do you think is wrong?,[supporter] Could it be for a reason you are unaware of,"[seeker] I'm not sure, I don't think I have done anything wrong, or bad, we haven't had a fight",[supporter] Maybe she is busy and the timing is off,[supporter] Does your friend work,"[seeker] Well, she did just move into a very large house, but she didn't even want me to help her, no she doesn't work",[supporter] May not be a fight but she is busy settling in,[supporter] Does she live with her family,"[seeker] Well, maybe, but does that really warrant her ignoring me? She lives with her husband.",[supporter] How long has it been since she moved in,"[seeker] A week and a half ago, not long, but not like yesterday",[supporter] have you thought about a housewarming gift,"[seeker] Hmm, no I didn't think about that, that may be a good idea",[supporter] So just a week and she is settling in,,,,298,Normal,"My best friend used to call me all the time (many times per day) and we would talk for hours.

[supporter] im here,[seeker] Hi. I'm anxious and a bit depressed.,[supporter] what made you feel this way?,[seeker] The pressures of Covid and taking care of my disabled sister are just getting to me.,[supporter] i see how that could make you a bit anxious. I get the same way also.,[seeker] Thanks. I'm just tired of the Covid restrictions. I can't wait for things to get back to normal.,[supporter] i feel the same. being on lockdown could make anyone a little crazy,[supporter] do you have family or friends that you could reach out to over the phone?,[seeker] I do. My other sister is always a big help. Maybe I should text her more often?,[supporter] yes! that would always be a good idea. its always comforting to hear from a loved one.,[supporter] i myself yearn for a good call from family or even hearing someone close voice. always makes me smile.,[seeker] That's true. I tend to stew on my thoughts.,[supporter] hows the weather where you are?,[seeker] It's not too bad. Cloudy and 40 which is pretty good for this time of year. How's your weather?,[supporter] i live in the south . not cold yet. but your weather sounds like it would be nice for a lovely walk.,[seeker] Exercise does always help. I walk/jog five miles every day. I generally feel my best right after that. Don't you find that true too?,[supporter] yes! although i probably couldnt walk nor run 5 miles a day. i love getting out to enjoy nature. it always helps to keep mind off things. does that usually work for you?,,,,606,Normal,"I'm frustrated with Covid, having family issues, and I'm the caregiver for my disabled sister. Plus the holidays have been cancelled and so I'm just pretty anxious and depressed",Lately I feel guilty when I take time for myself even though I need it,"Caregiver guilt is very common, and your needs still matter. What drains you most, constant responsibility, lack of breaks, or worry about your sister?",I know I need to recharge but I feel guilty,"Your need to recharge is valid. Even small breaks count, a short walk, quiet time, or a supportive call. Do you have anyone who could give you even brief respite once a week, like family, a friend, or a community service?",TRUE
"[supporter] Hi there, how are you feeling right now?",[seeker] I am feeling a high level of anxiety.,[supporter] I am really sorry to hear that - I've been there too. Can you tell me more?,[seeker] My car had some issues recently and the mechanic bill is adding up and getting bigger and bigger. I am not sure how I am going to pay for it all.,[supporter] That sucks. Has the pandemic been making your financial situation worse?,[seeker] Yes. My wife lost her job due to it and it has put a larger burden on us financially.,[supporter] There is government help available for people who are financially suffering I believe - have you looked into this?,"[seeker] Yes, unfortunately I make too much money to qualify with my job. It still is a huge burden not having the income we depend on from my wife.","[supporter] I am really sorry. Is she able to get any other sort of work, even if it's less well paid?",[seeker] We're trying. She has a few interviews set up next week.,[supporter] Do you have any friends or family who might be able to help?,[seeker] No. We just moved to a new city in the past year so we don't know many people.,[supporter] That is a dilemma. What sort of field did your wife work in?,[seeker] administrative work.,[supporter] Has she considered temping? I did that when I was between permanent jobs and it was quite good.,[seeker] No we haven't yet. That's actually a pretty good idea.,[supporter] It's not as well paid but you can choose your own hours. There's also online gig work out there too,,,,1151,Normal,I had some recent car trouble and the problem has gotten worse. It has caused the mechanic bill to get bigger and bigger and I don't know how I am going to pay for it,Lately we might apply for local jobs for my wife even outside her field to reduce pressure,Unexpected repair costs can feel crushing. Do you have a written estimate and a breakdown of what is urgent versus what can wait?,I want her to feel supported and it is hard seeing her stressed,"Supporting each other matters. You could ask the mechanic about prioritizing repairs or payment options, and set a simple job search routine for your wife.

"[supporter] Maybe he feels ashamed about watching porn, that's why he tried to hide. I would hate it too if my partner watches porn","[seeker] yeahhh, my friends have given me very mixed opinions abt what to do lol","[supporter] Other than that, is there anything else?",[seeker] and it wasn't just like he lied once he did it constantly over the course of a year of dating  and hid everything and cleared his search and all that,[seeker] he gets very upset when I bring it up. that's mostly our issue its just hard for me to move past it bc I was cheated on by someone else in the past so it makes me hard for me to forgive him and not be jealous lol,"[supporter] I think you should be firm, let him know how much you hate what he did and how much it affected you. I think it's a serious issue, him not being honest with you over trivial things. At the same time, breaking up  without any other issues is kind of not optimal considered you;ve dated for 1 year",[seeker] I mean I def let him know I hate it,[supporter] Did you see any changes in behavior after that?,[seeker] I feel like its maybe not something worth breaking up over but its just gross and makes me feel bad,"[supporter] you should tell him that, and let him the problem is you feel disrespected when he watches porn while dating you",[seeker] yeah truuue tysm. one of the girls he lusted over goes to college w us and she literally got kicked out of her sorority last year for sexually assaulting a guy who was passed out drunk and posted it on her snap story and he didn't care at all bc she posted cute pics of her booty lmao I was just so disgusted since I was r*ped last year at a frat house and like idk how u can still have any kind of attraction to people who do terrible things like that,[seeker] its so annoying boys are gross and I am def overly sensitive but its frustrating lol,"[supporter] I am so sorry to hear that, you are not oversensitive at all. Trust me, any normal girls would feel the same",[seeker] I appreciate it,[seeker] should I break up with him since I can't get over him doing that,"[supporter] Breaking up over this is a pity, however, he doesn't seem trustworthy after everything you told me. How about give him some time, 3-6 months and see if he changes at all. If not or if you really think he's not worth your time, go ahead and cut tie with him","[supporter] you deserve someone who respects you, it doesn't take that much either",,,,442,Normal,I am deciding if I should break up with my boyfriend or not because we are fighting a lot,Lately I feel stuck because I care about him but trust is hard to rebuild,"Feeling torn is normal when love and doubt collide.

[supporter] Well yes I can concur with that. I have often found work takes my mind off my problems.,[seeker] Work can set you free from your own thoughts,[supporter] Well that's not a phrase that I much like. But there's nothing wrong with liking your job.,"[seeker] Oh sorry, wasn't saying it in the same context of Hitler. It actually predates the Nazi's . But nonetheless it can be taken the wrong way. My bad.","[supporter] It's okay :) I did not realise that it predated Hitler. On another note, tell me about your job?",[seeker] Just your typical dead end job working for a corporation. Got to make the mortgage payments. But given how many people are out of work we are supposed to be happy to have a job.,"[supporter] Well, a lot of people have been made redundant due to the pandemic - but that is not a reason why people should be happy with a dead end job. Would you consider something else?",[seeker] Yeah just don't have the confidence to find a new job. I get paid a decent wage and the work isn't hard. It just isn't mentally rewarding.,[supporter] It's okay to coast for a while if it's paying the bills but in the long term it won't be very satisfying. What would be your chances of retraining?,"[seeker] There's no other positions at the company I work at, I would have to leave the company. I am at the top of my position being a supervisor.",[supporter] What about a whole new career though? Something you'd never even considered before?,[seeker] That would take a lot of motivation to change careers.,[supporter] I know but think about how worth it it would be! Did you have anything you wanted to do as a child that you never did?,"[seeker] Not really. I didn't have those types of dreams. I went to college , got a job, make money. Pretty much achieved what I set out to do. Didn't realize it wouldn't bring happiness.",[supporter] Could it possibly be some sort of mid life crisis? I am forty five and frankly am starting to question everything in my life.,[seeker] Yeah I am a few years shy of a midlife crisis but I joke about it being a mid life crisis all the time.,[supporter] heh it does creep up on you trust me :D,,,,1067,Normal,The holidays always make me sad,Lately I feel lost and the pressure to be happy makes it worse,"Pressure to perform happiness can deepen sadness. Does it feel like loneliness, grief, stress, or a seasonal dip in mood that comes every year?",I keep busy but it feels overwhelming and I go through the motions,"Going through the motions still counts as surviving. You might try one small daily comfort ritual and one small connection. Is there any holiday moment that feels even slightly okay, like lights, music, or a movie?",TRUE
[supporter] just borrow his mobile phones from them,[seeker] They say we can do studies if you let us to play game,[supporter] just strictly told them to do study 1st and got a good mark then only you will give them their phones.,[seeker] yes i will try this thanks to giving me support,[supporter] yeah sure.thanks too,[seeker] They are saying to me that study is boring and playing games is fun,[supporter] then told them to study or else you will broke that mobile.,[seeker] yes but those are very expensive,[supporter] isn't that expensive when compared to your child goodness,[seeker] yes you are right my kids study is more important then this,[supporter] yeah then do this automatically your kids will start to study.,[seeker] Thinks for giving me support,[supporter] sure i am always ready you to give my support,"[seeker] Thanks, buy",[supporter] bye,,,,,,1029,Normal,I'm in depression because my kids not listen to me,Lately I keep explaining why studying matters but nothing changes,"Repeating yourself without results is draining. How old are your kids, and is the main issue motivation, distractions like phones, or defiance and attitude?",I think they would respond better if I share my own experiences,"Stories often connect better than lectures. You could add one small routine with clear expectations, then praise effort. What is the most urgent behavior you want to change first, study time, respect, or following rules?",TRUE
"[supporter] Hi there, how are you feeling today?",[seeker] Hello,[supporter] Hi :) Is there anything you'd like to talk about? Something on your mind?,[seeker] I'm concerned about my job. I have been out of work for the past 5 weeks because I tested positive for COVID-19.,"[supporter] Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access?","[supporter] Oh I am so sorry to hear that! Are you at least getting sick pay? If not, are you getting advice about help you might be able to access?","[supporter] (sorry for duplication, not sure what happened there!)","[seeker] It just keeps getting better...  I applied for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and was approved.  The next day, I got an email asking me to verify my identity (I am fine with that.  It actually makes good sense.)...",[supporter] So you have been getting some assistance?,[seeker] So I did as instructed and got the message on the website thanking me for verification.  The following week I got a physical letter saying I was approved and the award amount per week.,"[seeker] I have gone online once a week and qualified, as one is supposed to do, and still I have not received a cent.","[supporter] I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank?",[seeker] Calling the customer service line is futile.  The computer just plays a recording that the agents are on other calls and then it disconnects the call.,[supporter] I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now.,"[seeker] I have been very fortunate.  People in my church have been bringing me food.  I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open.",[supporter] I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all.,[seeker] I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved.,[supporter] That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault!,,,2,Normal,I have been out of work for five weeks in quarantine due to testing positive for COVID-19.  I fear that my employer will not take me back to work even once I test negative,Lately I contacted my employer but I have not heard back and it is stressing me out,"Uncertainty like this is really stressful. Before this, were they usually slow to respond, or is this silence new?",They were slow before and replied with generic responses,"A structured follow up may help, one concise email and one call asking for a timeline and point of contact. It can also help to begin a backup plan so you are not stuck waiting. If you want, I can draft a short follow up template",TRUE
[supporter] That seems very cowardly to break up with you over text after being together for a year.,"[seeker] Yes, I thought so too!  He knew I'd be upset and he didn't want to deal with me I guess.  He knew I wanted to get married some day from the very start.  He knew it didn't have to be soon.  I'm still in college.  I just want to know that he wants marriage some day but he decided that marriage is an institution he doesn't believe in.",[supporter] That is a shame. I can understand his perspective if marriage is not something he wanted but it seems hurtful to string you along in  a relationship if your life goals were very different. Was your differing opinions on marriage the only reason he gave?,"[seeker] Yes, It was completely unexpected because things with us were going great.  I was completely blindsided.  We hadn't even talked about marriage lately.  He just knew that it was something that I wanted in the future.",[supporter] That sounds very difficult. How have you been coping with the break up?,[seeker] I've just been crying and laying in bed.  I called off work today.  I don't want to see anyone right now.,"[supporter] I think this is to be expected from a very fresh break-up. I know that when I broke up with my partner, I spent at least a few days crying and trying to figure out what my life would be now.",[seeker] How 'd you get over it?,"[supporter] I tried to focus on other areas of my life and to critically reflect on my relationship. Largely, I threw myself into my work and tried to better that aspect of my life, and hung out with people that I knew cared about me. Both of those are very good distractions which you might be able to use.",[seeker] Maybe calling off work was a bad idea...  all I'm going to do is think about this instead of doing something to take my mind off of it...,"[supporter] I think one day off to get the crying out of your system is a good emotional cleanse. We all need time to self care and look after our emotions. Maybe going for a walk or doing some yoga, to place your focus on something rather than being boxed into a room may help to shift your focus.",[seeker] I think I'm going to get out of bed and do something to take my mind off of this .  Thanks for chatting with me today!,[seeker] I think I'm going to do that!  There is a park by my house that I'm going to go for a walk in!  Some fresh air might be good for me!,[supporter] You are more than welcome. I hope that you feel better by being outside.,,,,,,,1230,Normal,My boyfriend just told me that he wants to break up because he doesn't see a future because he never wants to get married but I do,Lately I keep thinking about what he said about marriage and it is hard to accept,"Marriage can represent deep needs like commitment and security. What does marriage mean most to you, stability, family plans, or feeling chosen long term?",I feel confused because I thought we shared values,"A clarifying talk can help: ask whether it is a firm boundary or fear and uncertainty.

"[seeker] Well yeah, but it's not the same.  I know I am doing the right thing, but it still sucks.","[supporter] Yea some times the right thing does suck, and i know its not the same. I do know zoom has removed the 40 min restrictions for thanksgiving, so at least you can see your parents as long as you want.","[seeker] Oh that's nice, I didn't know that.  Thanks.  I thought about trying a video wifi call on the phone but that would be better.",[supporter] Thought it might help a little. These times do hurt but at least you are being smart about it. I would maybe try to plan something fun you guys could do over the call. Make it a bit interesting.,"[seeker] Yes, I think I going to get some bread pudding and drop it off over there too.  I can take enough precautions to make sure it is safe for them.",[supporter] Oh thats nice that you are close enough to be able to do that now. At least you will be able to taste a bit of home cooking right?,[seeker] Yeah I guess we can do a toast and stuff on zoom.  That might be a little better.,"[supporter] Yea, and hey maybe when the vaccine is readily available and we can start seeing our family safely again, we can make a new tradition. A new V-Day celebration heh.",[seeker] Are you kind of in the same boat?  It helps a little bit talking with somebody that is.,"[supporter] Yea, i have my daughter and partner. But we usually have a big family dinner with people coming in from all over the country. We are trying the zoom thing too. Gonna be hectic but hopefully fun","[seeker] I see, well my family isn't that big but we do try to get together every thanksgiving to have a good meal and hopefully watch the Cowboys win.  This will be the first time in a long while that I can even think of we aren't doing it.","[supporter] Yea i dont think anyone here has missed one in years. My partner will be cheering on the cowboys for you as well ha. I was trying to tell my partner though, traditions have to start somewhere, why cant now be time to start a new one?",[seeker] That's a fair point.  Hopefully this will only be a one year disturbance with these vaccines on their way.  They should both have theirs well before then and hopefully me too.,[supporter] Yea it is looking good with for both vaccines right now. I always try to focus on the positives. You can almost always find some good in a bad situation.,[seeker] Agreed.  Well you have been most helpful letting me vent a little and talk about it.  Thanks a lot.,[supporter] Not a problem. I hope you get to see your family sooner than later. No reason why you cant cook up a nice turkey when we can!,[seeker] We will make it through this.  Take care and thanks a lot.,[supporter] You too and stay safe!,,,665,Normal,Not being able to visit parents for Thanksgiving because of Covid,Lately I have been thinking about preparing the meal together over video,"That is a warm and creative way to stay connected. What do you miss most, the food, the traditions, or simply being in the same room?",We will make favorite side dishes and compare them,"Sharing cooking can create real togetherness. You could add one small ritual like sharing gratitude or a quick game to make it feel complete. If you want, I can suggest a few simple virtual Thanksgiving ideas",TRUE

Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue,[supporter] Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered?,[seeker] The HR department favours managers so I am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further,[supporter] I'm sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated.,"[seeker] Thanks, that's good to hear",[supporter] I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion.,[seeker] It's hard to be positive when I feel like my manager is not receptive to my opinions and just trusts the feedback given by this one other person,"[supporter] I've worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co-workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn't be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth.",[seeker] Maybe it is time for me to start looking elsewhere for better opportunities. I've worked at this place so long that I have become comfortable here and the thought of searching for a new job is intimidating,"[supporter] You've got this! It's easy to become comfortable in what we know but, change causes us to grow.","[seeker] Yeah I agree, it's uncomfortable and difficult though! I haven't searched for a new job in so long, I feel like I will perform terribly at the interviews",[supporter] Just start slowly and remember that you can be picky about what position you chose. I also think we all feel like we perform badly during interviews. Preparation is key.

Have you ever been in a similar situation, and if so, how did you handle it?","[supporter] If it comes from the job insecurity, I would do it proactively and find another job first.","[seeker] That would be tough for me now during the pandemic, and even though there are jobs like mine that are available, it might involve more travel than I currently have to do, do you have any other options for what might work for me to help me to overcome my anxiety?",[supporter] You may exchange information with your colleagues and see if there is anything you don't know.,"[seeker] That is a very helpful idea, have you ever been in a similar situation?",[supporter] No. I never had such an experience.,"[seeker] It is not fun, please let me know if you have any other ideas, or if after talking to my colleagues they tell me that they are in fact conspiring against me",[supporter] The best strategy is to find another place.

Even the most normal person will go crazy at that rate.,"[seeker] My thinking is that I had stuck to this for so long it's not my style to compromise and I tend to be stubborn. And that if I had done that, I would have done that early on this year. But other people are doing it but it's also coupled with the pandemic in which I just don't think I or anyone should risk that, since I am basically sacrificing myself, while others in my apartment building are walking freely in and out. So that's my thinking.","[seeker] Yes I understand. I do know it's bad to get stuck indoors. Believe me, before all this, I was going out many times a week to the movies and to the gym.","[supporter] I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people","[seeker] Now I just do a lot of time nothing but on the computer or in my studies. A lot of the time aimless, not even studying that well or using my time well. And I don't have the same motivation to work out that much at home, which I used to do a lot.",[seeker] exactly. I understand your feelings too on that.,"[seeker] A lot of selfish people inviting others indoors or going out, even a few months ago when the cases were just dropping and they didn't take enough time to wait but immediately lift their own restriction and go out.","[supporter] I'm also sick of the repetition too. Everyday I go to work then go home and just get stuck there all nigh every day. However, we need to tell ourselves that this too shall pass","[seeker] But even when there were a lot of cases, there are some people on my floor that walked freely in and out many times in one day when  it wasn't safe for anyone. And I didn't get that at all and that was when I was angry and anxious of their actions.",[seeker] Because that risked my safety too,"[seeker] sorry to hear that you have similar repetitions. That's how it feels. Everyday is the same. And when I talk with my folks on the phone, I have nothing new to share except about the pandemic, because that's the only thing new, and I only call the once a week.","[seeker] But yes, I do believe that it will pass at some point.",[supporter] that's the right way of thinking. You're doing this not only for yourself but for everyone else,[seeker] yeah that's why I told myself early on I am doing this for everyone and I couldn't compromise no matter what. Perhaps too stringent but that was my thinking.,"[supporter] I try to stay away from the news or talking about covid, mostly because it's gonna be the same information and only depresses us even more",,,,,,720,Normal,General daily stresses,Lately I have been trying to keep a routine at home but I miss social interaction,"It makes sense to miss connection. When you miss people, do you want deeper support, or just light casual contact to feel connected?",I had a video call last week and it helped but it is not the same,"Mixing formats can help, a short weekly call plus a shared activity like watching something together or walking while on the phone.

Or are you staying somewhere else?",[seeker] I am currently trying to find a way to get to my mom who lives about 150 miles away. Im staying with my friend for now but she said I can only stay for 2 more days,[seeker] Yeah break ups are the worst,"[supporter] I'm glad to hear that you are with a friend right now during this hard time, and that you have a place to go! But I see the struggle is finding a way to get there.",[seeker] Yeah she is a good friend im happy that I can stay with her for the time being its just stressful trying to get to my mom,"[supporter] If you are struggling on finding a way back to your moms house, it might be a good idea to loan or borrow some money from either friends or family, or open a credit card just for the time being. Then once you get back to your mom's, you can start focusing on yourself and get yourself back on your feet! IT's important to not overwhelm yourself right now, so focus on one thing at a time",[seeker] Yeah I definitely agree. I am waiting to hear back from capitalone about getting approved for a credit card and my friend said she can loan me 70$ but the bus ticket to my mom is 150$ so I'm almost to my goal I'm working on it though.,[seeker] It does make me feel better to talk about it though and lay it all out it makes it easier to figure my stuff out,"[supporter] That is great to hear! I know that you are probably also hurting from the breakup itself too, but I'm glad to hear that you are focusing on getting yourself to a safe place first. It's going to take a long time to fully heal again, but as long as you make sure you are stable, you will be able to get through this","[supporter] It also sounds like you know what you need to do, and you aren't letting yourself forget what is important. That is wonderful",[seeker] Yeah thanks I appreciate that. I feel a lot better I hope you have an awesome day!,[seeker] I do understand what I need to do for sure,[seeker] It was just overwhelming thinking about everything and talking it and listing it out makes me feel better for sure,"[supporter] Yeah that's great.

I was in that with my mother. Unfortunately if they do not want to get the help, it wont really go anywhere no matter how hard you try.

It can be really difficult to live with someone who has issues like that.",[seeker] yes i am mentally disturb now a days,[supporter] Then i would suggest to talk to a professional as well.

Have you tried maybe going for a walk alone, clearing your mind, seeing where you are at?",[seeker] meditate myself,"[supporter] That is very good, i usually dont ask that at first as hiking can be a form of meditation.

And it gets worse as it gets closer to the test. If I'm not studying, I feel guilty that I'm taking a break.",[supporter] I understand that. I have felt the same way before.

I think I would have feelings of regret,[seeker] The trust wouldn't be there anymore.,"[supporter] I think that either way you choose to proceed there is always the choice of remaining amicable.

Do you think there would be hateful feelings even if we decided to resume the friendship?,[supporter] If you're trying your best to move on and the other party ends up with hateful feelings then I feel like at least you gave it your best right?

That is probably the most difficult part.,"[supporter] Yes, it sounds like a part of you still misses the retail environment. I see that too. My best advice, is take a few days to think about what you really want to do.  Think about what you are skilled at. Then decide which route you want to go.  I know there will be numerous options out there for you in retail management, but if you wanted to do something different, there will be opportunities there too. Because you have options, you will likely pick the choice that will be most fulfilling for you, in something you will be passionate about - so this will likely be very positive for you.",[seeker] That is really nice to say.

You mentioned before that you feel like you are with him mostly because you are lonely, is that how your relationship started?","[seeker] That's a good point you make.  I was lonely and wanting to fill that void.  But, I do want a family.  I'm just not sure he is that committed or even mature enough to handle this responsibility.

I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her?,[supporter] Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.,,,,,,,,,646,Normal,I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I'm too scared to do anything about it as I don't want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it,"I want to talk to her without sounding like I am attacking her, but I also cannot keep swallowing this feeling","Feeling scared and ashamed does not make you weak, it means the relationship matters to you. Before you talk, what do you actually want to learn, reassurance, honesty, a boundary, or a decision about the relationship?","I think she might get upset at first, but maybe she would understand if I say I feel insecure","That is a thoughtful approach. You can focus on your experience rather than accusations, for example I have been feeling anxious and I need clarity about where we stand. If the conversation becomes heated, it is okay to pause and return when both of you are calmer",TRUE
[supporter] Are there any organisations that you could just call and explain your predicament to?,[seeker] I don't know any as I never faced such situation before and my partner was there to support the family. Now there is no support of him. life is becoming misearable.,"[supporter] Do you have friends who could help you, even with child care?",[seeker] One of my friends was really helpful. She moved to different city last month. After that I am totally shattered.,[supporter] I can imagine that that must have been traumatic. You will make new friends though.,[seeker] Life is becoming hard day by day. I am feeling guilty that I can't feed my kids well. No one wants to do friendship with poor people.,[supporter] I am a poor person too and I'd be happy to be your friend. We have to stick together!,[seeker] Thank you so much for all your support. You will be a  great person for sure. I would like to be your friend but I have nothing to return.,[supporter] No need to return anything but friendship.  Thanks for talking!,[seeker] I would try to search near by food bank or NGOs as you suggested . Thank you so much for all you help.,"[supporter] No problem at all ... I've been there :( (genuinely, not just for the HIT)",[seeker] Your words are motivational and it gave me positivity to move forward.,[supporter] Best wishes :) You need to press quit from your end though cos I can't do it from my end :),,,,,,,,1259,Normal,Lost my job and unable to find the new on,I am trying to manage time better because I have to handle everything and the kids too,"That is a heavy load, and losing work removes the breathing room you used to have. What does a typical day look like right now, mornings, school time, evenings, and bedtime?",I try to make a schedule and the kids keep me going even when it is hard,"A routine can be a real anchor, especially for kids. You might keep the schedule simple with a few fixed points, meals, homework, job search block, and one short rest period for you.

Do you have an online support network?",[seeker] What do you mean by support netwrok?,"[supporter] Well, friends you can talk to during this difficult time?

Would there be any delay between the sounds from different instruments?,[supporter] No I don't think so :) I think that it is totally live so you could play just as you would if you were together in person.,,,,,,,,,3,Normal,I am depressed staying home due to COVID,"I have been thinking about playing my favorite songs alone, but it feels strange without the band","Music can hold a lot of emotion, and playing solo can still be meaningful. What do you miss most about the band part, the sound, the energy, or the social connection?","I think I would enjoy it, it just feels different without them","Different does not mean worse. You could try one short session with a clear goal, like playing one song through, then stopping before it becomes draining. If you want connection, you might share a quick recording or set a remote jam time so it feels less isolated",TRUE
"[seeker] Hello, I'm good and yourself","[supporter] I'm doing well, thank you!",[seeker] I am really a little upset.,[supporter] I'm so sorry to hear that. What's going on that's making you feel that way?,[seeker] Me and my partner had an argument and I got ghosted after. It's been 2 weeks.,[supporter] That's terrible. So you had an argument and he hasn't spoken to you in two weeks. Is that correct?,[seeker] Yes,[supporter] I can imagine that you must be really hurt amongst a number of other feelings.

If you don't mind going into a little more detail, I may be able to help you more.",[seeker] I was sick and he did not call me all day to even check in on me. I told him that I was upset about that.,"[supporter] That must be such a terrible feeling. So the argument started because you were sick, he didn't check in on you at all for that entire day, and when you expressed your feelings to him, it turned into an argument?","[supporter] Has he ever acted this way towards you before? For example, has he ever shown a lack of empathy towards you like this in the past?",[supporter] Are you still there?,[supporter] Have you tried reaching out to him throughout the course of these past two weeks to see if he would respond?,,,,,140,Normal,The person ghosted me after we had an argument and I am really upset about it,"I feel confused because we were okay, then they stopped talking, and I keep replaying what I said","Sudden silence after conflict can mess with your mind because you have no closure. What was the argument about, something small that escalated, or a deeper issue between you two?",I keep wondering if I said something that hurt him badly,"It is natural to review your words, but you do not have all the information. If you choose to reach out, a short message that names the situation without blame can help, something like I noticed we have not talked since our argument and I would like to clear the air if you are open to it. If they do not respond, that also tells you something important",TRUE

Today is a good day! So how can I help you?",[seeker] Lucky!

What do you do in the hour leading up to bed time and what do you do in bed before you sleep?","[seeker] I tend to watch TV or check my phone, once in bed I just try to relax and close my eyes",[supporter] I made a rule in my house where we cannot use any technology 1 hour before bed time. We read a book for example.,[supporter] That might be something you can start to implement in your schedule. Cutting out technology 1 hour before bed time.,"[seeker] I think that is a good rule, I have to recognize I use too much technology specially towards the evening/night","[seeker] I will try to stop all that and have a read tonight, what about if that does not work? Have you tried anything else?","[supporter] Don't feel bad, we all do it in this day and age.",[seeker] Thank you,"[supporter] I also have a playlist of what's known as ""white noise"". Think of rain falling on the windows, a stream of water flowing, birds tweeting. This is what I listen to while I'm lying in bed waiting to go to sleep. You could try this as well.","[seeker] Yes! Thank you for that. I do love music and also the sound of the nature, it relaxes me... so I think that can work",[seeker] I don't want to have to take pills to sleep or something like that if I can avoid it,"[supporter] Sometimes sleep issues are not about you doing something wrong, just about how you can set your mind in a better place.",,,987,Normal,Every night I try to go to sleep and I am actually tired but once in bed I cannot stop thinking about tons of things and I cannot fell asleep,I keep thinking about my to do list while lying in bed and it keeps my brain awake,"That makes a lot of sense because bedtime becomes planning time. Do the thoughts feel like worry about consequences, or just reminders of tasks?",Writing the list earlier might help because I normally hold it all in my head,"Writing it down can signal your brain that it is handled. You could also set a cutoff time for planning, then do a simple wind down routine such as light stretching, slow breathing, or a short audio story. If the thoughts return, gently redirect by saying I will handle this tomorrow and go back to the breath",TRUE
[seeker] Not good.,"[supporter] What's wrong, do you feel like sharing?","[seeker] Well, my girlfriend and her grandmother are extremely  depressed.",[seeker] The husband of her grandfather is driving everyone nuts with his yelling. Nothing makes him happy.,[supporter] I am so sorry to hear that. Sounds like your girlfriend and her grandmother could use some time away from her grandfather.,[seeker] Kind of hard when he is the one that owns the houses. Doesn't seem right to leave him. He is going through dementia right now.,[seeker] He always supported them. Just sucks now he is causing so much sadness.,[seeker] He sees me like a son but end of the day. I have to do right by my girlfriend. I love her and her family.,"[supporter] His dementia is causing him to become upset? Your right he does need to be around family and needs love and support, and you are not doing wrong being on your girlfriend side.",[seeker] Yeah. He keeps going to the VA and they keep saying he is losing brain mass.,[seeker] Wish everyone else knew how to deal with him. Doesn't seem like everyone is equipped to deal with this kind of stress.,[seeker] My girlfriend already has enough on her plate with her chronic illness. Mostly the arguing starts when he tells her to eat 'normal' food. Which everyone has to keep reminding can kill her.,[supporter] Is there any way you guys could get a nurse that deals with patients that have dementia to help him out?,"[seeker] Well, problem is that he is extremely fit and stubborn. That could be a solution. Not in his current state though... He would lose his mind. He is a veteran... so. He could lose it.","[supporter] What about getting a nurse, would make him lose his mind?",,,,,,204,Normal,My girlfriend has a rare condition that can be very expensive to just keep her healthy. Her grandparents are supporting us and the grandmother's husband is going through dementia and making everyone stressed and could possibly die leaving 3 houses to pay off,"I want to support her grandfather without overwhelming my girlfriend, especially with the yelling in the house","That is a lot of stress in one family system, medical, financial, and caregiving. When the yelling happens, does your girlfriend feel guilty, frightened, or pressured to step in?","She needs to feel like she has a choice, and I do not want to push her into anything","Respecting her autonomy is really important. You might offer options rather than a single plan, like we can visit for a short time, we can call instead, or we can step away when things escalate. It may also help to agree on a signal you both use when she needs a break so she does not feel trapped",TRUE
"[seeker] It might, I am not sure but I don't think my boss will like the idea","[supporter] Sometimes it's important to remember that part of your bosses job is having this kinds of conversations, even though he might not like the idea.",[supporter] It might be a good idea to have this conversation with your boss. Hold them accountable for this part of their job.,[supporter] Do you think this could be a good idea?,"[seeker] You are right, I should let them know what I want too",[supporter] It sounds like this might be a little intimidating for you.,[seeker] I'm not a very direct person so I don't really like confronting,[seeker] but I think i should have this talk with my boss,"[supporter] It might feel that way. But if this is something that might benefit your future, it doesn't mean it's a confrontation.","[supporter] But rather, an affirmation of your skillsets.","[seeker] You're right, you make me feel better about the decision",[supporter] I am happy to know you will try this. I know you can do it!,,,,,,,,,559,Normal,I'm worried that my career is not developing and I have no growth,"I feel more confident about approaching my boss, but I want to do it the right way","Confidence is a good foundation, and a clear structure will help you be taken seriously. What kind of growth are you aiming for, new responsibilities, promotion, pay, or skill development?","I think I can share my goals without sounding confrontational, I just need to be specific","Specific is exactly the move. You can bring two or three concrete goals, the business value of each, and a request for a timeline or next step. For example I want to lead a project, I want feedback on what skills I need, and I would like a checkpoint in six weeks. If you tell me your role, I can help you phrase it in a strong but respectful way",TRUE
[seeker] yeah,"[supporter] Thats tough , do you have a set school time?","[seeker] Kind of, but the schedule is a bit weird, like every other day I only have an afternoon class and on the others I have both morning and afternoon, and if a teacher has a meeting then no class. Now that I'm saying it I guess it is a bit irregular.",[supporter] it sounds like your schedule is different almost everyday. I know I find schedule changes like that to be hard to manage,"[seeker] Yeah, my sleeping schedule is also very irregular due to this. At most I get 5 hours on a good day","[supporter] ouch without the right amount of sleep , everything is difficult. Have you thought of setting your own schedule to follow?","[seeker] I'm not really good with stuff like that, every time I try and make a schedule for myself I end up disregarding it because there' s just no point",[seeker] Also I think i should mention that I do online school through google meet,[supporter] no point- what do you mean by that ?,"[seeker] I mean that its not like anyone is holding me to the schedule anyways, and I feel like I should spend my time doing something I like instead, you know?",[supporter] I see - you find it hard to stay motivated when something pulls your attention to something you are more interested in doing . Does that sound right ?,"[seeker] yeah, thats right",[supporter] Have you thought about why doing your school work is important ?,,,,,,,,1224,Normal,I have so much homework that I can't keep up and I dont feel  motivated in my classes because im so behind,I feel stressed watching assignments pile up and I do not know where to start,"When you feel behind, motivation often disappears because the task feels infinite. What is the most urgent thing due first, and which subject is hardest right now?",I take breaks sometimes but then I feel guilty like I am wasting time,"Guilt is common, but breaks can prevent burnout. A helpful compromise is timed breaks, for example 25 minutes work then 5 minutes rest, repeated a few times. Also, picking the smallest next action can restart momentum, like opening the assignment and writing the first sentence, or doing the first two problems only",TRUE

I have increased the time I work on there, so that will help some.  I would love a second source as well, however...just so I could really save some.",[supporter] I hear you on that. I am disabled and the extra income helps a lot for my family. Unfortunately until the pandemic ends a part time job might not be in your best interest for now. Ebay flipping takes some time to get into as well but could help.,"[seeker] Yes, I have thought of that, actually.  I have quite a few items I would love to sell.  I have never done it, though, so need to research how to ship items, etc.","[supporter] Its actually very easy now. You can print out the slips at home and they tell you how much it will be. I have done it a few times, the last time was only a couple months a go.","[seeker] Well, I will definitely have to check that out.  It would serve two purposes : decluttering and making money.  I think I got anxious last week when I had a tire go flat and took my car in to get it fixed.  I found out I need all new tires and new brakes.  Not easy on a fixed income.  Plus I am widowed.","[supporter] I am sorry for that. Yea having a nest egg is ideal, but i know how hard it can be. I think with the extra cash and space it may be a big help to those anxiety issues. Do you drive a lot as it is now?","[seeker] I actually don't. Only to the grocery store, or to visit my daughter who lives about 20  minutes away.",[supporter] Well at least you are not putting to much wear on them now. Have you checked with local governments for assistance? Even with things like medication?,"[seeker] I am not on any medication, which I am so thankful of.  I have not checked any programs for assistance.  I'm not sure if I would even qualify.  It wouldn't hurt to try, I guess.",[supporter] Believe me never hurts to try. A penny you save on something else can be a penny that goes into your savings,[seeker] That is so true!  I have been selling some items through my neighborhood online Marketplace and made $100 just this week.  I have also started a change jar.

From a practical angle, what kind of items are you planning to sell, and where, online marketplace, local groups, or consignment?","She is excited, and I think it could bring us closer too","It could be a meaningful project together. You might divide tasks based on comfort, she can handle packing and shipping, and you can handle pricing, photos, and customer messages in short bursts.

[supporter] I also deleted old messages from my partner so I didn't dwell on the past as much,[seeker] How does talking to friends help?,"[supporter] It depends on the situation, but for me I had a lot of unresolved feelings from not getting proper closure, so ranting to my friends about how my partner hurt me helped satisfy that",[supporter] Do you have friends you feel comfortable talking to about this?,[seeker] I have couple of close friends I can talk to.. but have not thought about doing so..,"[supporter] I think it could be helpful, friends can be really supportive","[seeker] Yes, I will give it a try...","[supporter] It's awesome that even though you're feeling so depressed, you're willing to give something a try to help you out of it",[seeker] Any other suggestion you might have?,"[supporter] Getting involved in a new hobby, or something you used to enjoy, can be helpful",[seeker] I don't have any hobby per say.. but I would like to travel new places..,[supporter] That sounds like so much fun!,[seeker] I will plan for some travel..,[supporter] That sounds like a great idea.

When you imagine the trip, are you looking for quiet rest, distraction through activity, or time to reflect?","Mountains or a beach, somewhere in nature to relax","Nature can be grounding. You could choose based on what your body needs, mountains for movement and cool air, beach for open space and slower pace. A small plan helps, a few gentle activities and plenty of downtime, so the trip supports healing rather than becoming another stressor",TRUE

Are you allowed to take a few notecards just in case?","[seeker] Thanks for understanding, yeah I suppose I could take notes. I think it is being in front of people and looking foolish that I'm scared of the most. I know a lot of people at work and don;t want them to think I'm bad on stage. Can you related to that?",[supporter] I can definitely relate. It is best to look past the audience and just focus on an object close by. Everyone of us have had to experience this. You are not alone.,"[seeker] Hopefully I can try to get past the nerves, some people make it look easy. I'm usually really confident but something about standing on a stage makes me feel very scared and anxious.","[supporter] Before you go on, try taking a few deep breaths.  Why not try meditating a few days before?",[seeker] I could do I suppose.

Focus on others congratulating you on a job well done.",[seeker] Yeah I do have a tendency to be negative sometimes and make a big deal out of things. I should actually focus on the good things. Has this technique helped you in the past?,"[supporter] Yes, in the term ""fake it until you make it."" I keep on thinking of what could go right, or in my favor, and when I am done, it actually went okay, and any ""fears"" i had, never came to fruition.",[seeker] I think that is really good advice. I think I have just suffered from a bad experience in the past and this has shaped my way of thinking to always be fearful.

Or do you just think that he is never going to change?,[seeker] We tried counselling once.. It was online and we got paid to do it.. I don't think he took it seriously at the time. He always said he felt like he was being attacked.,[supporter] I am sorry to hear that. So you feel that he is not really taking your problems as a couple seriously?,[seeker] Yes.

At first everything was great but now things are so distant I just don't know what to do next.,[supporter] Do you feel that perhaps it might be time to move on? People who will cheat twice are pretty unlikely to ever change their ways.,[seeker] That is true. But now we have a kid together and I feel like it would break her heart to lose her dad,[supporter] Ah you did not mention that! Maybe for the sake of your child it might be worth going to counselling again then.,[seeker] Maybe but a place that we won't get paid to go... I think he thought of it as a job or something. I got a lot out of the experience and still use the skills to this day. But with a unresponsive partner those skills will not work.,[seeker] Can you recomend a good site to find affordable services?,[supporter] You could ask your doctor to recommend something that will not cost you too much but will be effective?,[seeker] That is a great idea I had not thought of asking my dr.,[supporter] They should be able to provide you with a list of reputable services local to you .,,,,362,Normal,Current partner cheated on me in the past and I think he is doing it again,I feel overwhelmed and I keep thinking about how this affects our child and what the right decision is,"It is heavy to carry mistrust while parenting.

I won't do it again. Can I ever give up the guilt that I feel and move on in our relationship or do I have to tell him what I did? I have known couples who don't tell each other and they are happy now.","[supporter] While it may be true in general that honesty is the best policy, in this case I wouldn't suggest telling him. It is just going to cause angry feelings.","[supporter] But, the fact you already believed he cheated on you and it motivated you to do the same shows a basic lack of trust in this relationship.

What are you most afraid would happen if you told him?",I want to show I am committed and be more open about my feelings going forward,"Being more open is important, and commitment includes accountability. If you decide to disclose, pick a calm time, take responsibility without excuses, and be prepared that he may need space to decide what is right for him.

I did not like her class at all.",[seeker] Those are the worst teachers. I wish teachers like those would get fired.,[seeker] I just want to have a chill time like most teenagers,[supporter] Is there enough time to maybe select more compatible teachers or speak with the school counselor about classes that work best for you?,[seeker] That's the thing. I never get to pick my classes. And they always give me crap recommendations.,[seeker] I Think I need to drop by the office,[supporter] That is a great idea. I'd encourage you to speak with your school counselor to share your needs and maybe the 2 of you can come up with a plan to create a schedule with teachers that can help you be successful.,[seeker] I am absolutely certain that I am capable of succeeding at school without over stressing. Hopefuly this will fix the issue.,"[supporter] I believe you are correct! Less stress certainly creates a better learning environment. School counselors are your ally. Remember, you can go to them anytime you need them. Are you stopping by this week?","[seeker] Maybe. If I have time on thursday or friday, I think I will go.","[supporter] I am so excited for you! This is a big step! Looking out for yourself, to assure you are happy, less stressed and learning the important things to be able to graduate.",[seeker] I agree...,"[supporter] For your next year, asking upperclassmen about their teachers can give you insight on who you may have next year. The more you know in advance, the better you can plan for what to discuss with your counselor. So proud of you! I know you 2 will come up with an awesome schedule!",,,232,Normal,I keep getting awful teachers and it makes school feel impossible,My classmates feel the same and we are thinking of going to the counselor together,"Going together is a smart way to show it is not just one person complaining. What are the specific issues you want the counselor to understand, unclear grading, unfair behavior, or lack of help?",Venting together helps and we want to bring it up as a group,"You can prepare a short list of examples and a clear request, like more office hours, clearer rubrics, or mediation. Keeping it factual will help. After the meeting, you can ask what next steps the counselor recommends so you feel there is a real process rather than just a one time complaint",TRUE
"[supporter] It definitely can help. Perhaps you could have a separate way of using some of the money to go towards some of the other bills you would like to pay off? Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns.",[seeker] i currently do that. it's hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money,"[supporter] Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that's used towards household bills.",[seeker] absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out.,"[supporter] Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers.",[seeker] no i haven't tried those yet,[seeker] do i have to pay for those scripts?,[supporter] You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use.,[seeker] So I could make more money on mturk than I am now by using those?,"[supporter] They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It's easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc","[seeker] oh wow, thank ya! I'll look into that",[seeker] MTS is a script? Which script should I use?,"[supporter] Of course, I hope it can be of use too you! One I use is Mechanical Turk Suite, which is an extension. I think you can look up as a search for extensions, scripts etc. Or Mturk forums and find out tons of help!",[seeker] Thank ya! I'll check it out,[supporter] You're welcome!

What kind of second job fits your energy and schedule, something remote, weekend shifts, or short gigs?",I want to enjoy life without bills hanging over me all the time,"That goal is valid.

Have you been able to at least speak to your doctor, even if you could not see them in person?","[seeker] Yes! So horrible! And yeah, I have a therapist I see once every two weeks. Although that only helps so much.",[supporter] It might be time to get some more help? Do you think it is bad enough that you might need inpatient treatment?,"[seeker] No, I'm not quite that bad off. It's sort of a mix of too many rough things. My wife and I are separating right now, I'm in the middle of a PhD program and living far from home, and covid really made it more challenging. I think it's a bit more circumstantial.","[supporter] It sounds like you have had a really hard time the last eighteen months. As the lockdown is easing, are there any new pastimes you could get involved in that might distract you?","[seeker] Well, I am starting to hang out with friends more and establish weekly traditions like poker night. So that's definitely helping. The more I can be around others the easier it is for sure. I'm wondering how bad it is to turn to alcohol when I'm in pain.",[supporter] Poker night does sound like something that might involve a lot of alcohol though :(,"[seeker] Haha, yeah maybe I should have specified that this is typically booze free. Sometimes we split a 12-pack among the 6 of us, but that's the wildest of nights. Engineers make for good sober poker night buddies :)",[supporter] LOL well I am glad to hear that at least. Splitting a twelve pack between six does not seem like a problem to me,"[seeker] Yeah, I figure 2 beers over 4 hours is not a big deal every once in a while. I just really hope we start opening back up and people get vaccinated. Although, maybe that is just masking some underlying problem, huh?","[supporter] That is possible as well and it is definitely worth talking to someone, I think, just in case","[seeker] Yeah, that's a good idea.

When you drink to numb, does it happen at a specific time of day or after certain triggers?",I miss the deeper connection I had and I cannot shake it,"Missing that bond is painful. It may help to build one or two places where you can be honest, a trusted friend, a therapist, or a support group, and also to look at your alcohol use gently but directly, because it can intensify depression and anxiety. If you are open to it, we can think through one small change that feels doable, like alcohol free nights or swapping in another coping tool when the urge hits",TRUE

Are you still having good bon? If you want to stay connected with someone it is really important to have communication with each other.,[seeker] yeah but i had a good family right now.i don't want to hurt them either.,[supporter] That's great if you want to move forward and forget about it.

[supporter] hi how are you feeling today?,[seeker] I am feeling sad,[supporter] why are you feeling sad?,[seeker] My friend of 5 years said that they hated me.,[supporter] oh hate is such a strong word for your friend to use,[seeker] Yes it was and I am dealing with family problems as well and she just told me she hated me with no reason.,[supporter] oh that is quite a pile of conflict on you. you must be feeling emotionally  overwhelmed,"[seeker] I am, why would someone want to do something like this. I am not sure if it was brought on by her boyfriend or what but she was one of my best friends",[supporter] the boyfriend could very well be the reason she is lashing out at you. maybe she is projecting her feelings toward her boyfriend onto you.,[supporter] has she had problems with her boyfriend in the past,[seeker] I am sure but I just wish she would not have said that to me. This is a new boyfriend that she started dating about 6 months ago.,"[supporter] you're feeling a bit like a punching bag because she has chosen such strong words without a reason, right?",,,,,,,,,399,Normal,My best friend of five years said she hated me and I cannot understand it,I keep thinking about our good memories and it makes her words feel unreal,"That contrast is shocking, and it makes sense you are searching for an explanation. Was this said during a fight, or did it come out of nowhere?",Now I am questioning everything and wondering if I did something wrong,"Questioning is natural, but do not automatically blame yourself. If it feels safe, you can ask for a calmer conversation to understand what led to that statement. If she refuses or keeps being hurtful, you may need distance to protect yourself, even if the history was meaningful",TRUE
"[supporter] So just so I make sure I understand, you are currently stressed about your money situation due to only working part time making deliveries for the time being.",[seeker] Yes,"[supporter] I can completely understand this, as I was also extremely worried about money when the pandemic first started and about not being able to be employed.",[seeker] It's so hard to find something else right now.,[supporter] Have you looked into hiring agencies to help you find a more permanent job during the pandemic? Hiring agencies are a great resource to find a job that fist you best.,[seeker] I have recently been in contact with one around here.  It unfortunately just hasn't happened as quickly as I wished.  Although that's life.  I'm hoping that it will progress.,[supporter] After interviewing with a company are you following up on a timeline or a decision? Companies like to see initiative in their potential hires after an interview.,[seeker] That's definitely something I'm lacking.

What kinds of roles are you applying for, and are you tailoring your resume to each one or using one version?",Some roles look promising but the competition scares me,"Competition is real, and you still have levers.

[seeker] Yes sometimes. I don't tell them how I feel though. I don't want them to worry about me.,"[supporter] I understand. However, there is nothing wrong with telling them that you are sad because you miss them. Something as simple as getting it off your chest can already make you feel better.",[seeker] I suppose. I just worry that I will make them sad too. It's hard time for everyone.,"[supporter] Totally, but remember than they are there for you whenever you need them.",[seeker] Yes that's true. Do you have any suggestions on what to say?,"[supporter] I bet something as simple as ""Hey babe, I really miss you. I can't be glad with your abscence"" could make your boyfriend feel loved while at the same time relieving you.",[seeker] That is true. I believe I have a problem showing vulnerability.,"[supporter] That might be why you were unsure about telling them. Believe me, there is nothing wrong with showing vulnerability. We are all vulnerable in one way or another.",[seeker] I haven't been with my boyfriend that long before the pandemic started so I still have some fears and trust issues. I fear that being weak pushes people away.,"[supporter] Hey, if he is the right one for you, he will completeley accept you as you are and love you. In the unlikely event that he ""rejects"" you for being ""vulnerable"", he wasn't even worth it in the first place. You deserve someone that appreciates you as much as you appreciate them :3",[seeker] That is true. I should be brave enough to find out if he will be there when the chips are down.

They wear masks while at work but they still have boyfriends and they don't wear mask with friends or boyfriends.,[supporter] So sometimes you worry that they aren't doing enough to protect themselves.,[supporter] I know I'm more worried about others than I am about myself right now.,"[seeker] Yes, and they are young so they do not understand how important it is to practice social distancing and wear a mask.  We have had so many covid tests.  Luckily they have all been negative.","[supporter] Maybe just reminding them that wearing masks protects both them and others could help? They sure wouldn't want to infect you or your husband, or others.",[seeker] I do but they are young and the young are selfish.  I'm not worried about getting covid.  I'm worried about having to quarantine at home and not work.  i supervise 15 people and if I get exposed I can't work for 3 weeks.,"[supporter] That is really relatable.

"[seeker] Yes, I have tried to message them daily, but the responses have always been clipped and or the response comes after couple days.

I would suggest inviting one of them out for lunch or dinner and express face to face how you are feeling right now.,"[seeker] I was thinking the same thing, but I am unsure I feel awkward now, I feel like I do not them as I thought I did. I am unsure why I feel this way. one of them is my daughters god mother and the text are there but they are not like they use.. I am unsure if I should ask why she has time for others and not us... just saying it makes me feel weird",[seeker] anyone there?,[supporter] She may be going through something at home or having family issues.  We truly never know what the other person is going through unless we have that uncomfortable situation. My suggestion would be to rephrase that question slightly to her.,"[seeker] I agree with you, just seems really strange since we were inseparable before the pandemic. I am also aware many are going through this situation just thought my friendships were stronger and distant would not be an issue.","[seeker] I will, never did I think I would hesitate whats going on..","[supporter] It's completely natural.  Instead of texting her, have you tried calling?","[seeker] Yes, I have. The conversation have been superficial, like small talk. There is nothing to share, I am guessing.

We have shared grand moments together.",[supporter] You both have been friends for such a long time.  I'm so jealous of friendships like that. I would definitely ask her for lunch.

What would reconnection look like to you, more frequent messages, a monthly call, or sharing specific moments again?",I worry it will sound needy if I say I miss her and I do not want to push her away,"You can express care without pressure. Something like I miss you and I miss sharing the little moments, no pressure, I just wanted you to know. Then offer one easy option, like a short call or sending a photo update.

A pet will help with your bond. Can you work with your injury? I have heard of online support groups that can help with support from work injuries.,[supporter] I would love to share with you some ideas about emotionally healing in conjunction with your physical.

If you decide to do it, visiting a shelter and spending time with different cats can help you find a good fit.

When you sit down to study, what triggers the overwhelm first, the volume, the difficulty, or the fear of falling behind?",The reading load for each module feels impossible,"One tactic is to stop reading like a novel and start reading like a researcher: skim headings, pull key definitions, then read only the sections tied to assignments. Breaking it into small timed blocks can also help. What is your next deadline, and what is the minimum reading needed to meet it well?",TRUE
[supporter] I can understand how angry unappreciated and burnt out you must be feeling.  I would feel that way too,"[seeker] It's been really rough. I've tried so hard to be there for her, and I feel like she just doesn't even appreciate it.",[supporter] I don't think she is a place to be able to see anyone but herself. She is self centereed self asbored and self pity party and doesn't care about anyone but herself right now . Is that accurate?,"[seeker] Yes, that's exactly accurate. And she is 50 years old, and the issues have all been high school type problems that I've been listening to. Stuff about how she didn't post on social media about her birthday, and little petty things like that. Not something an adult should be concerned with. And I still sat and listened to her all that time.",[supporter] I completely understand how unappreciated and stressed this would make you or any person. Especially when our plate is full and its the same old same old and nothing is changing. Its like thinking doing same thing over and over you will get a different result when 2+2 equals 4,"[seeker] Yes, exactly.",[supporter] You are an extremely good and loyal friend and I am so proud of you. Most people would have left her.,[seeker] Thank you. That's really important to me. She was starting to convince me that I wasn't a good friend because I wasn't there for her right now when I had problems of my own. Real problems - like my daughter's engagement breaking up.,"[supporter] However, it is time to take the hard road. YOu are going to have to say with LOVE because its not always what you say but how you say it.  Give me a minute to please type it","[seeker] Okay, thank you.",[supporter] You are going to have to sit her down and say  I need to be honest with you.  I have always been there for you but you are not willing to take my advice or others advice and quite frankly I just can't do it anymore. IF you want to remain friends I need you to grow up and realize the world doesn't revolve around you or even me.  Right now I could really use a good friend. I am going thru A LOT OF Sh** and I don't need this in my life. So,[seeker] I think that's a good idea. I'll try that.,[supporter] if you aren't able to do that than I am afraid until you can be a true friend and not just a user than I need to end this friendship . I don't want to but I need to for my mental health and for myself and even for you.  I say this because I love you and I do care but this has become toxic,"[seeker] Yeah, I like that. I think it's a good idea to say those things to her.",[supporter] she really needs to hear it and it sounds toxic to me . I know I wouldn't want a friend to accuse me of not being there and from the chat look like its all about her and she s acting like a spoiled brat,,,,,,451,Normal,My best friend has been demanding and I am upset,"Whenever I share my own issues, she brushes them aside and it exhausts me","That pattern would drain anyone. When she brushes you off, do you feel dismissed, guilty for bringing it up, or pressured to switch back to her problems?",I feel invalidated. I know I should stand up for myself but it is hard,"Standing up for yourself can be gentle. You might try a sentence like I want to support you, and I also need space to share my stuff too. Then watch her response over time, not just once. If she cares, she will adjust. What boundary would feel most reasonable for you to start with?",TRUE
[seeker] Hello?,"[supporter] Hello, How are you?",[seeker] I am okay,[supporter] That is wonderful to hear. How is life going?,[seeker] It's alright. A little stressful with my job crisis.,[supporter] Oh I know how hard it can be to be stressed out. What is going on with your job?,"[seeker] Well, I've been looking for a proper job for some time now and I just can't find one. I work online every day and it is not something that is stable.","[supporter] Oh yeah, not being able to find a job can be pretty stressful. Have you checked online, on job websites?",[seeker] Yes. I have submitted hundreds of applications and I don't even receive an email on most of them.,"[supporter] Oh yes, that happens most of the time when applying for jobs. It's okay, you will definitely find one. Have you tried asking friends/ family? Maybe places that friends and family work at, have job openings.","[seeker] I've asked a few, but most of the people I know work retail jobs. I make more money than that working online. I just want a normal adult job, you know? I went to college, so it shouldn't be that hard.",[supporter] Of course! Everyone deserves to have a job that they worked hard for. What kind of jobs are you interested in?,"[seeker] I like museum jobs or jobs that work with animals, but all of those require years of experience that I can't get because no one will hire me","[supporter] Oh okay, well while looking for job try not to put yourself in position where you take deep breaths and let your mind at piece. Patience is everything. Sometime in life we all have our patience tested, but that is OK because at the end the results are better than anything.",[supporter] I mean try to put yourself in that position.,[seeker] That is true. Maybe it just isn't the right time. Maybe I need to learn something before I find a job that I need to do,"[supporter] Of course! Everything comes at a perfect time, and we have to learn to be patient, and while waiting we can indulge in other activities that we like.",[supporter] While doing your online job maybe you can work in activities that build experience for a job you want to do next time.,,,1131,Normal,I feel like I will never get a proper job or move out of my parents home,I have been thinking about volunteering at an animal shelter for experience,"Volunteering can build confidence, routine, and references. What kind of job do you ultimately want, something with animals, something different, or you are still exploring?",I think it would be rewarding and could lead to opportunities later,"That is possible, especially if you treat it like career practice: show up consistently, learn tasks, and ask for a reference when the time is right. You could also add a small skills goal alongside it, like learning a tool or taking a short course. What is one skill you want on your resume within the next month?",TRUE
"[supporter] I understand how you feel, it's tough not being able to work and earn much money. However, you are doing your best right now and should feel proud of yourself",[seeker] Thanks. I appreciate that. What do you do to stay encouraged or confident?,[supporter] I try to spend more time outdoor and keep myself busy.,[supporter] I like to cook since it's very relaxing and helps keep my mind concentrated,[seeker] cooking for me is just another chore. But getting outside might help. I live out in the country. So I have nice scenery.,"[supporter] That is perfect then, the nature is very healing. You can also hang out with friends and talk to them about how you feel",[seeker] It has been days since I even sat on the porch. And weeks since I took a walk.,[supporter] you should definitely do that. staying indoor will worsen your mentality,[seeker] That's a good idea. What sort of projects are you working on? Job? Hobby?,[supporter] yeah I have a full time job and working on mturk at night. Covid has hit me financially too,[seeker] Wow. that's a lot.,[supporter] we all face different pressure and have to find ways around it,,,,,,,,,772,Normal,"I lost my job in January. Because of health, I am afraid of taking work outside home. I am trying to earn money on MTurk and YouTube",I have been thinking about making YouTube videos about job hunting and my experience,"Sharing your journey could help others and also give you a sense of purpose. What would you want your channel to feel like, practical tips, honest diary style, or encouragement for people in similar situations?",Telling my story might make me feel less alone and maybe inspire someone else,"That is a solid reason to start. You could outline five simple topics, record short videos, and improve gradually. Consistency matters more than perfection. What is the smallest first video you could make this week, maybe a three minute story about one lesson you learned?",TRUE
"[supporter] Oh biking is an excellent activity to do with everything going on. How are you feeling with it all? What are you studying in school? I'm just getting household chores done, nothing too exciting.",[seeker] I'm feeling alright. The current pandemic situation in my city has made it restricted to be with people other than immediate family so that's been tough.,[seeker] I'm currently studying finance and I'm loving it. I'm in my last year so I can't wait to finish that up,[supporter] I understand that it is really difficult to be kept on lockdown.,[supporter] Are you biking regularly to help with the feeling of being stuck inside?,[seeker] Yes. It's great that my city has a program where we can get a bike pass for $99/year. There are bike stations set up all over my city so that has helped with my sense of being cooped up.,[seeker] It's really helpful in these times to find something to keep yourself productive and mindful that things are going to get better,"[supporter] I agree, It's really great that you are finding ways to get out of the house.",[supporter] Have you tried video chatting with the people you can't be around right now? That has really helped me not feel so alone right now.,"[seeker] I have and that has helped for me as well. I also have a dog so that has helped me have the feeling of being around ""someone"" even though they're not human.","[seeker] I haven't video chatted anyone in quite some time though, I probably will do that later on today!","[supporter] Well, I think it's great that you are finding things like biking, playing with your dog, and video chatting to help get you through these times.",,,,,,,,,893,Normal,I am depressed about my grades and I am not understanding some subjects. It causes a lot of emotional stress,I am trying to keep my spirits up but isolation makes it harder,"That combination can wear you down. When you get stuck, is it because the concepts are unclear, or because you feel too anxious to start?",I made a schedule and it helps me stay on track and feel less overwhelmed,"A schedule is a strong foundation. Next, you could identify the one or two subjects that need the most support and add one focused help action per week, like office hours, a study group, or a tutor session.

"[seeker] I am nervous about receiving another pay cut and reduced hours. I dont think I can handle it financially, the fear is real.",[supporter] I am very sorry to hear that. Facing pay cuts at work can be a very stressful situation.,[supporter] Are there situations or moments that specifically make you feel like this is going to happen? Or are you just feeling a general sense of anxiety and fear it might happen?,"[seeker] Yes, specially with the disastrous winter storm I underwent. Makes me nervous if our state decides to shut down to combat the pandemic. I am unsure as to what to do","[seeker] I believe its more of a general sense of anxiety. I had to take a 25% pay cut with reduced hours, it was a complete lifestyle change. Not only for myself but for my children","[supporter] I can definitely understand why that would be difficult.  Dealing with uncertainty during the pandemic is extremely difficult, as there are so many unforeseen circumstances.","[supporter] One thing that helps me out in those moments, is to remember that there are things in the world and life that I can control, and others that I can't control.","[seeker] Yes, I could not agree with you more. Specially now that I have tapped into my savings and retirement. Never in life did I think I would worry about paying my light bill.","[supporter] It seems like the best thing you can do at the moment is try your best to do the best you can at your job. If there will be paycuts, you might not be able to prevent it. But at least you will know that you gave a valiant effort.","[seeker] Thank you for the kind words. I have control of some aspects. Perhaps I will apply for an additional job, just to ensure I have a steady income. Thank you for the guidance. If you dont have any other advice we can end our interchange after this reply.","[supporter] I just wanted to remind you to remember, anxiety about something that has not happened yet is not always helpful to yourself. By focusing directly on what you can do, you can make sure you are prepared for anything negative coming your way.","[seeker] Thank you, I will keep that in mind.",[supporter] Is there anything else you need help with?,"[seeker] No, not today I feel a lot more calm and gained a better understanding of my emotions and the situation I am finding myself in.","[supporter] Good, I am very glad to hear that. I am wishing you the best in the future and definitely feel free to contact me if you need support again!","[seeker] Same to you, thank you for understanding and offering really good advice, i am guessing I had forgotten that there are things I can control",[seeker] I am unsure how to end our chat,"[supporter] Do you need any help with any other questions? Otherwise, there is a quit button on the side.","[seeker] No, thank you for putting everything in perspective for me. goodbye.",[supporter] You're welcome. Don't hesitate to contact me again! Have  a great day.,1207,Normal,I am afraid of another pay cut and reduced hours. I am worried about finances and I am using my savings to stay afloat,I have been thinking about budgeting but it feels overwhelming,"Budgeting feels heavy when you already feel threatened. It can help to start with clarity rather than strict rules. Do you know your monthly essentials, like rent, food, and bills?",I thought about tracking spending and cutting non essentials as a start,"That is a good first move. You could track for one week, then choose one small cut that barely hurts, like one subscription or one takeaway meal. Also, building a plan for a worst case scenario can reduce anxiety because you are not guessing. What is the biggest expense you wish you could reduce right now?",TRUE
[supporter] hello how are you today,[seeker] Not great. I'm feeling pretty down in the dumps.,[supporter] Im sorry to hear that. how can I help,"[seeker] I'm not sure how, exactly. I'm dealing with repeated rejections.",[supporter] That is always tough especially during this time of year and been there myself.,[supporter] What type of rejection  are you experiencing,"[seeker] Romantic rejection. It seems like every time I make an effort, it's immediately shot down.",[supporter] I hate to ask you this but are you male or female?,[seeker] Male. Why do you ask?,[supporter] I ask it changes the perception on how I may help you because male and females deal with things differently.,[seeker] Fair enough. What do you suggest I try?,[supporter] I am going to ask you a few questions if OK i don't want to sound like i am prying.,[seeker] That's fine. I'm open to discussion.,"[supporter] OK do yo live in a rural or city, are you into male females or the like?","[seeker] I'm in a rural area, and I'm interested in women.",[supporter] I too live in a rural area understand the complexities of tying to find someone. So my next question where looking to find that special connection.,,,,,88,Normal,I keep experiencing romantic rejection from people I am interested in,I have been discouraged because I have not met anyone new lately,"Repeated rejection can hit self worth, even when it is not personal. Where do you usually meet potential partners, friends of friends, apps, or local events?",Most attempts end with polite but firm rejection and I feel stuck,"It hurts, and you still have options. You could widen the pool by trying a new setting, like interest based groups, volunteering, or a different app. You can also focus on one part of your approach to refine, like first messages or where you meet people. Would you be open to experimenting with one new way to meet someone this month?",TRUE
[seeker] School is the start of the problem. I know that if I quit I can still be successful elsewhere but I also feel if I quit I will let my wife and kids down who were willing to leave family and friends to follow me to the school I wanted to go to.,"[supporter] I understand what you are going through. It is as if you are being pulled in two directions, but are not sure which is the best option at the given moment. I think it is great that you wanted to go back to school, but if your heart is not in it, then it may not be what you should continue pursuing.","[seeker] I know I want this though. I enjoy what I do and what I would do for my career if I graduate. I mainly feel inadequate. I feel that I am not good enough. I am willing to do whatever it takes but fear that whatever my ""best"" is may not be good enough.","[supporter] I can feel your worries when you speak about your anxiety, and I am hoping we can find a way to approach your feelings. Do you think there was a specific instance that is causing doubts within yourself or is it in your nature to self-doubt?","[seeker] It is in my nature to self doubt. Additionally, I have had a few bumps in the road during my program and struggle to pick myself up after those bumps. For example, I am on academic probation and have a certain expectation over the next few months that I have to hit to stay in the program due to struggles in previous classes. I am reaching the bar just fine, according to those that I work with, and often feel I am doing quite well but occasionally I start to panic and think that I am not doing as well as I think that I am and start to spiral","[supporter] This has also been a past struggle of mine, and I think it partially stems from the bar we set so high for ourselves. We obviously cannot reach the top right away, but have to work our way up. Often times, when facing an obstacle, such as a bad grade, we might retreat further down the path due to fear that it will keep happening. I know that I personally had a tendency to think of my family and friends who I feel are dependent on me or comparing myself with others when the only person we should think of in these instances is ourself. When making progress, tiny steps upward matter more than you think. But when we take a step backward, we cannot fall back down to the starting point by letting our doubts pile upon one another.",[seeker] That is a really good point and helpful. Thank you!,"[supporter] Of course, I am happy to help! I have noticed that letting yourself celebrate a good grade can be really helpful to feel that you are enough and making good progress. But when things do go south, because life certainly happens, we must stay in the present and live life like we usually would, with a drive that we are going to push harder against whatever we have to face next.",[seeker] That is exactly right. I need to focus more on what progress has been made and not on what progress hasn't been made yet because there is still time to make that progress.,"[supporter] Exactly! I also suggest if you are having doubts, talk it out with someone like your partner or a close friend. They can often provide a pick me up you didn't even know you needed. More than anything, give yourself credit and relax. Take some time to just breathe and release the tension. I guarantee it will leave you feeling refreshed and fulfilled for the next tasks you have to face. I believe you can do this and I feel that you believe it too, which is amazing. As often as it is said, believing in yourself is truly the best foundation to achieve your goals.",[seeker] Thanks for the advice and believing in me. This has been challenging and your words of encouragement give me hope for the future .,"[supporter] You're welcome. It was great talking to you. Your future is bright, and I wish you all of the luck for the endeavors to get you there.",,,,,,,,,1181,Normal,I feel like I am failing in my graduate program and I am not good enough to earn my doctorate,"I have been practicing mindfulness for anxiety. It helps sometimes, but worries return, especially about academic probation","Mindfulness helping even a little is meaningful, and the probation fear would keep anyone on edge. What is the main worry, failing a class, disappointing others, or losing your program spot?","I feel centered when I practice, but the worries come back quickly","That is common.

Have you thought about doing that?,"[seeker] No, I don't feel qualified",[supporter] Temporary agencies are helpful to employers and employees like yourself.

Before we go further, are you safe right now, and do you have someone you can contact today if things feel too heavy?",I miss coworkers and simple daily conversations,"That daily contact matters. You could recreate some of it by scheduling small social touchpoints, like a virtual coworking session, a weekly call, or an online community around an interest. If the hopeless feeling gets stronger or you think about harming yourself, reaching out to local emergency services or a crisis line immediately is important. You do not have to hold this alone",TRUE

All my happiness is wrapped up in this corona virus.9 Friends, family, coworkers, outings.)",[seeker] How do you deal with death?,"[supporter] I cry, crying actually helps since it relieves the pain youhave to go through. After you cry, your body tends to be exhausted and you can just sleep without thinking","[supporter] However, the best way to cope with death and depression in general is stay outdoor, be closed tothe nature",[seeker] This is true and I have noticed that crying over this is something I have not done much. I do workout intensely 4 times a week but that has fallen off too. I do workout inside with a home gym. Maybe running outside wouls be more beneficial and help me feel closer spiritually towards her.,[seeker] I thi nk I'm still shocked a little.,"[supporter] I have noticed that whenever I'm depressed, I feel better staying outdoor so try doing that more often.","[supporter] I understand.

When you imagine honoring her, what feels most fitting for her personality, something quiet, something social, or something creative?",I thought about a small gathering to share stories and celebrate her life,"A small gathering can give you shared mourning and shared love.

I fear she might blame me for what Thomas shared,"Starting the conversation calmly can help.

My parents and friends watched out for me too.,[seeker] we are lucky they look out for us. they can't all be wrong if they're guiding us a certain way,[supporter] I think you hit the nail on the head that it's helpful to have that support.,[seeker] absolutely. i appreciate your help! nity nite,[supporter] Thanks.  Can I assist you with anything else?,,,,,611,Normal,My friend did not like that he dumped me. She told him he was an idiot for doing that,I keep thinking about what my friends said and it makes me cautious,"Being cautious can protect you while you heal. When you think about caution, what boundary are you most wanting, less contact, slower pace, or stronger standards for respect?",I want to take my time and not rush back in. I do not want to get hurt again,"Taking time is wise. You could define what would need to change for you to consider reconnecting, like accountability, consistency, and clear communication. If those are not present, it is a sign to keep moving forward. What is one non negotiable you want in your next relationship?",TRUE

I really have not had much time to grieve myself since she is my first priority.,[supporter] Time will heel her. That I can assure you.,[seeker] Do you have any suggestions what I might try to cheer her up?  After that I can worry about myself,[supporter] Tell her to meditation or yoga in the morning. This will definitely helped and her mind will be  busy,[seeker] That might be ok.  I know she likes Neil Diamond.  Maybe get some of that playing while she meditates.,[supporter] That is wonderful idea too . She will recover soon,,,,,,,,1200,Normal,My aunt died a week ago who was 90. Was very close to her,I have been looking through old photos of my aunt. It is nice to remember the good times,"Looking through photos can be such a gentle way to stay close to her. When you look at them, what do you notice yourself feeling most, comfort, sadness, or something in between?",There are so many. I remember her laughter and our family gatherings. It is bittersweet,"It makes a lot of sense to feel both at once. If it feels right, you could share one favorite photo or story with your mom and invite her to share one too, not to force anything, just to feel connected together. What memory of your aunt do you think your mom would smile at?",TRUE
[seeker] it happened about a week ago..my boyfriend is being very possessive about everything I do,[seeker] I find it not convincing and broke up with him,[supporter] I see.

Were you consciously taking some measures to get over the stage?,[seeker] Yeah iam implementing of taking a new hobby which is distracting me a little,"[supporter] On average it takes me about a year to get over this. I feel like there is no better person for me, I don't know what the future brings, and I am imaging all the scenarios where past relationships could have been successful for me. I took a lot of walks and spent a lot of time with friends.",[seeker] yeah those are two good strategies to follow..I will be considering them,[seeker] Do you have used any counselling?,[supporter] I didn't. I wasn't able to afford them. I actually felt bad about venting the situation to my friends. They offered a lot of emotional support and I am sure they didn't want to seeing me like this.,[supporter] Do you have a support system in place? Are you considering getting counseling?,[seeker] Even I cannot affod a counsellor..But Iam too embarraseed to talk to my friends..,[seeker] Yes ..Iam thinking about getting a counselling,[seeker] do you know any best counsellors,"[supporter] I am glad that you are preemptive about it. I think one year in, if you still constantly think about it, a counseling session would help you get closure. Even if it is a one session, you can always assess after trying this out. My current company actually offers free counseling session if I want to, I understand it is called ""One Medical""?",,,1051,Normal,facing a breakup with the partner,I have been thinking about the relationship more lately and I wonder if talking about it will help me process,"Wanting to talk it through is a healthy instinct. What moments have been looping in your mind the most, the last conversation, earlier warning signs, or specific fights?",I keep replaying moments trying to figure out what went wrong. I feel sad and confused,"Sadness and confusion are very common after a breakup. If journaling appeals to you, you could try writing in two parts: what you know for sure happened, and what you are guessing. That can bring clarity without spiraling. What is the hardest question you keep asking yourself right now?",TRUE

Have you tried to help it or see a doctor?,"[seeker] Yes, I have. I tried some natural things at first, but it did not work. Then I went to the doctor, and guess what? He said I am having insomnia due to anxiety.",[supporter] Do you feel anxious though? maybe the doctor is right and maybe loosing stress is the answer :),"[seeker] I think so, I am worried about my future with the pandemic, I guess we all are. I am from Brazil and lots of people are dying there.",[seeker] I have lost 2 relatives to COVID in Brazil and also lost 4 friends there,[supporter] Yeah the pandemic hit badly there. I am sorry for your loss. Perhaps you just dont want to follow in the same pathway which is why you are stressed,"[seeker] exactly. I am also very stressed because I have too much on my plate with school, working full time, kids at home distance learning",[supporter] Yh thats seems like quite a lot and I know how you feel because of when I was a student. If i made it through you can too!  try your best,"[seeker] Thank you. The doctor prescribed an antidepressant that should help with anxiety and a sleeping pill, but I dont want to take it",[supporter] If you dont take it you might never feel better. I would advice you to take it and see how you feel after,,,,,,,,1030,Normal,I have not been able to sleep well worried about so many things,I have been trying to implement a nighttime routine to help with insomnia,"That is a solid step. What does your routine look like right now, and what time do you usually start winding down?","I read before bed and limit screen time, but my mind still will not shut off","It is frustrating when your body is tired but your mind keeps running. In addition to reading, you might try a short “brain dump” earlier in the evening where you write worries and tomorrow tasks, then close the notebook. Would you like to try a 5 minute version of that and see if it helps at all?",TRUE
"[seeker] Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else's pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss (the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year.",[supporter] That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!,[supporter] Are there any official routes that you can use to complain?,"[seeker] I work in supply chain and I see the actual sales numbers and realized 4 months ago that we were actually on track to exceed our plans, even with the covid reductions. a few weeks later I heard him tell our sales director to keep the numbers artificially low so that they will both get their bonuses",[seeker] I don't think so... He's the VP there isn't anyone I can go to above him,[supporter] That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?,[supporter] It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this,[seeker] I don't know if it is or not... I used my EAP benefit through work where you can talk to a councilor for free (5 visits) and they said that it's unfortunate but they didn't think it was illegal.,"[supporter] I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me. Have you considered looking for another job? I realise it's a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though","[seeker] yeah, it's tough.. I don't know if anyone is hiring. because of the timing like you mentioned.",[seeker] I've looked a little bit though,[supporter] I really can't wait for this year to be over! It's been so awful. Do you suppose anyone at all has had a good year?,[seeker] haha I don't know... I'm sure someone has... heck the VP is getting a Bonus... so I'm sure he'd say he's having a good year,[supporter] Well yes fair point! Us poorer people are not doing very well though!,[supporter] Have you tried to talk with any of your coworkers about this? I would suggest that it might help.,,,,,,363,Normal,My boss reduced my pay so that he gets a bonus,I have been talking with coworkers and they feel similarly. It is frustrating to see him manipulate numbers,"It makes sense that you feel angry, and it can help to know you are not alone. When you and your coworkers talk about it, are you thinking more about understanding what is happening, or about what options you have to address it?",We might bring it up together if things do not improve. There is strength in numbers,"Approaching it together can feel safer. Before you do, it may help to get clear on facts you can document, like the pay change terms, timing, and any written policies, and then decide what specific outcome you want to request. What would “improvement” look like to you, restoring pay, transparency, or a clear future plan?",TRUE

What is your biggest fear?,[seeker] I think I'm most scared that I'm going to study a lot but not do well and then not get good grades in my classes.,[supporter] Did the teacher provide you with a study guide?,[seeker] Only one of them did. I have a total of 4 finals.,"[supporter] Okay, are you familiar with their testing style?  I am assuming you have had other test in these classes.","[seeker] Yes thankfully I have. In all my classes, I have had tests before.

Study hard and be confident, you have made it this far, your almost done.",[seeker] Thank you for your kind words!

That will help you feel less stressed.",,,,,,,,591,Normal,I am really nervous about my finals coming up. I want to do well,I started reviewing some material and it helps a little,"That is great momentum. What is your exam schedule like, and which subject feels most urgent right now?",I am mainly studying for math and history. I feel more confident in math,"It helps that math feels steadier.

Did you have the dog before the relationship started?,[seeker] my dog was 13 years old. she was very close to me. i had her when she was a puppy,[supporter] The dog then lived a very happy and fulfilling life from what I can tell. Dogs are among the best companions to ask for.,,,,,,,212,Normal,we recently broke up and now i am very sad,I keep thinking about our last moments together.

When you replay those moments, what feeling comes up most strongly, sadness, guilt, anger, or shock?",I still care about her and worry about how she is feeling too,"It shows you have a caring heart. At the same time, it is okay to focus on your own healing first. If you want clarity, you could write down what you wish you had said, without needing to send it. What do you most wish had gone differently in those final moments?",TRUE
[seeker] I try but the loneliness is the hard part,[supporter] It sounds like this loneliness is really getting to you and you are struggling to see a way forwards.,[supporter] As you are a writer could you perhaps try to make some online friends in forums?,[seeker] It is just the lack of communication,[supporter] I hear you.,[supporter] Perhaps you could call one of your children now?

When your anxiety spikes, what does it usually attach to, uncertainty about the outcome, deadlines, or feeling alone with it?","I keep busy with writing, but the anxiety still sticks","Writing is a strong coping tool.

Talk to me, what's happening?",[seeker] My father and I had a fight 2 years ago and haven't spoke since.,"[supporter] The same happened to me, and then my father passed away. If there is anything I can say, is to swallow pride and cherish the moments you have on earth together. What was the fight over?",[seeker] Yeah I am afraid that these things can happen. It was only over material things.,"[supporter] That was my next question, what the fight was over. Do you think he would be open to mending things?",[seeker] It is weird because I called him out for being manipulative so this is his defense.,"[supporter] Usually when people feel singled out, they only have a few mechanisms. Unfortunately, most people tend to run away instead of fixing things. It tends to be the easier option.",[seeker] I would likely take advantage of an opportunity to be the bigger person.,"[supporter] When you try to fix things, just remember that this is his method.

When you say “a break,” do you mean a short pause during arguments, or more space in the relationship for a while?","A short break seems good, but I hope he sees it that way","It is understandable to worry about how he will interpret it.

[supporter] Hi! What seems to be the issue?,[seeker] I'm depressed...,[supporter] When did this start?,[seeker] Since as long as I can remember. I've always been depressed.,[supporter] That sounds really hard. Depression is tough to manage.,[seeker] I know. It feels like I've tried everything but nothing works.,"[supporter] I can feel that you have a lot of pent up frustration with this, especially after trying so hard.",[seeker] Yes. I used to be angry but the anger has become sadness...,"[supporter] Lot of research shows that feelings of anger can morph into depression, that is not uncommon.","[seeker] I never knew that. When I was young, I was very angry but I held it inside.","[supporter] I can tell that this has been very hard for you, especially since it has gone on so long.","[seeker] Yes, it has. I'm still hoping that  there is a cure.",[supporter] Why do you think you were angry?,[seeker] My parents got divorced and it ruined my childhood.,"[supporter] Ouch, that sounds really hurtful, but I know you are doing your best now.","[supporter] My parents divorced when I was young, but now I understand it has given me the opportunity to grow stronger as an adult",[seeker] That's a good way to look at it.,[supporter] Do you participate in any peer support groups? Those can really help let that emotion release?,"[seeker] No, I don't. I could look into it.","[supporter] Of course, there's lots of information available online for local meetings. Perhaps trying a group like ACA could really connect you with your inner child.",55,Normal,I am very depressed. I always have been. I do not know how to fix it. I tried therapy and medicine but they do not seem to work,I have been thinking about how my parents divorce might have changed me,"That is a meaningful connection to explore. When you think about their divorce, what messages do you feel you absorbed about relationships or safety?",I always feel like I am waiting for things to go wrong in relationships,"That kind of hypervigilance makes sense after instability. Since therapy and medication have not helped enough so far, it may be worth exploring different formats, like group therapy, a different modality, or a new clinician fit. Also, if you ever feel at risk of harming yourself, getting immediate help is important. For now, would you be open to describing what “waiting for things to go wrong” looks like day to day?",TRUE

How do I tell him,I feel anxious about how to bring it up to him,"That anxiety makes sense because timing can feel high-stakes. What is driving the desire to leave earlier, opportunity, finances, safety, or just feeling ready?",I worry he will not be on board with moving earlier than planned,"You could start by sharing your reasons and inviting his perspective, rather than presenting it as a decision already made. For example, “I have been feeling ready to move sooner and here is why, how does that land for you?” What would a good outcome look like, agreement, a compromise date, or at least feeling heard?",TRUE
[supporter] I get it. Sometimes I find dishes so overwhelming that I will let them pile up. Maybe together we can figure out a way to break it into smaller tasks.,"[seeker] Ok, I suppose I can try that. But I don't quite know where to start.","[supporter] It is so hard to figure out where to start sometimes. Ok, I'll help with a plan. Maybe you can glance at the dishes and pull out the largest one that is dirty. Let's start there.","[seeker] Ok. That makes sense. There is a large pot. I think if I was that, maybe it would get me started.","[supporter] yes, starting with the large pot would be a great place to start! Good thinking!","[seeker] Ok, but then what?","[supporter] Well, washing the pot will make the overall task look smaller. Then, let's pick a second type of dish to focus on. After you wash the large pot, try to focus on larger bowls, then plates and cups. You could leave the silverware for last.","[seeker] Oh, thank you so much! It helps my anxiety to talk through a plan. Sometimes I get so anxious, it is hard to figure out how to break a large task down to something manageable on my own.",[supporter] I am always happy to help. I find it difficult sometimes too.,[supporter] I really think you are figure out how to get through this and help your anxiety.,[seeker] Wow do you think so?,[seeker] Have you every had anxiety like this?,"[supporter] Yes, I have. I often look at work assignments as larger than they are and can only get started when I break them down.",[supporter] I really think you have done great job figuring out how to tackle the task that is causing you anxiety.,,,,,,,1004,Normal,"I keep trying to get started, but my kitchen mess seems overwhelming",Talking helped and I feel more capable. I think I can wash the big pot first,"That is real progress. Starting with the hardest item can create quick relief. After the pot, what is the next smallest step that would make the kitchen feel noticeably better, a quick trash sweep, clearing one counter, or stacking dishes?",Knowing I have a plan helps and makes me feel capable,"Celebrating each small win matters. You might set a short timer, finish one mini-task, then pause and notice the difference before choosing the next.

"[supporter] As hard as it is to think about, you'd also have a piece of her",[seeker] I would probably be a shell of a person if something happens.,[seeker] I just always been terrified of children.,[seeker] I keep telling her but she wants like 3 kids,"[supporter] Do you simply not want kids? Because if she does and you don't, you can't blame it on her condition, that would be making her give up something that wouldn't be fair.",[seeker] Yeah. I try making that clear.,[seeker] But no one wants her to die.,"[supporter] I understand, you may need to have a hard conversation with her.",[seeker] I don't really have an interest for them. Maybe I'll be there and love them the same at the time. But currently. I just don't see me being feeling any sort of way later,[seeker] Yeah. I've told her like 20 times.,[seeker] I'm starting to think she can't process normally.,[supporter] Maybe you're not right for each other if you have such different views on this subject. Neither one of you should have to give in to something they don't want.,[seeker] Well it's not like I actively don't want kids,[seeker] I just don't want her to die.,[seeker] Or for the kids to die from something I can't control,[seeker] I had so many siblings die,[seeker] Seen what it did to my father. And he is not the same,[seeker] I've been to so many funerals as a kid for young children in my family. I just don't see kids the same way anymore.,"[supporter] Unfortunately it sounds like you've had a lot of experience with that, and I can understand that. I've been to my fair share as well.

When you think about her future worries, what do you imagine she fears most, symptoms, finances, independence, or something else?",She tries to stay positive but I see worry on her face sometimes,"It makes sense that both of you carry it differently. Creating small positive moments can help, and so can gentle check-ins where you ask what kind of support she wants that day.

I h ave not talked to them","[supporter] I would suggest talking to them about the expectation. You could say something like, ""I want you guys to realize that I am trying my best but when you put this expectation on me and makes me even more stressed out""","[seeker] Okay, I can try that, it makes me very anxious.  Would writing a letter be okay?",[supporter] That is a scary conversation to have. I think the letter idea is a great idea!,[seeker] I am better at expressing my feelings that way.,[supporter] I'm better writing things down too.,[supporter] Writing that should hopefully let them see what is going on. I think it will work.,"[seeker] I hope it will work, maybe I will write it and leave it in the morning for them to find after I go to school.  That way they can think about what I said and not just react.",[supporter] That's an even better idea. Great thinking!,"[seeker] Thanks, you have made me feel a lot better.",[supporter] I'm glad. I hope it all works out for you!,,,,,,592,Normal,I fear disappointing my parents,I have been thinking about how my sister would react to the letter I want to write,"You are trying to be careful with everyone’s feelings, which shows you care. What is the main purpose of your letter, to explain yourself, to ask for support, or to set a boundary?","I think my sister would be supportive, but I worry she might feel pressured too","That is a thoughtful concern. You can reduce pressure by stating clearly what you are and are not asking for, like “I just want to share how I feel, you do not need to fix it.” What is the one message you most want your sister to understand?",TRUE
[seeker] Yes. My mom never approves of most of the things I do.,[supporter] What kind of arguments did you have with your mom?,[seeker] Like the kind of friends I should have. I believe I have freedom to choose my friends not her.,[supporter] I had similar situation like yours. My mom did not want me to make friends with some people.,[seeker] Really? How did you deal with that because for me it makes me angry.,[supporter] I just had good conversations with my mom to express my thoughts.

It is understandable.,,,,,,,1006,Normal,I am angry at my mother. She criticizes everything I do,I feel like she does not see the positive changes my friends bring into my life,"That sounds really frustrating, especially if you feel unseen. When she criticizes your friends, what do you think she is worried about, your safety, your future, or losing influence in your life?",My friends motivate me in school and encourage my hobbies,"Those are meaningful positives.

[seeker] My parents keep putting pressures on me to be the best in the class and with my learning difficulties I am finding it had to cope,[supporter] I can understand parental pressure. They want to see you to be a successful person.

I am just worry that my parents will not be very understanding. My parents are too strict and they don't like to hear any complaints or excuses.,[supporter] Most of the parents behave like this when it is regarding their kids future. When I was in school same thing happened with mw. They know us very well I realized now.  Try to talk to them everyday for a while. It might work.,"[seeker] Maybe you're right! Although, my parents have a very busy schedule but fingers crossed when I do find time to talk to them they will understand me.","[seeker] I sometimes feel like someone older needs to talk to them, maybe then my parents may take it more seriously",[seeker] Well!

They will stop doing it for sure.,"[seeker] Hmm..interesting because now that I think about it, I believe this could have contributed to the stress and anxieties that I have been experiencing. When I don't get support from anyone I feel so alone, timid and down",[supporter] Try to take small break while studying and try to relax,"[seeker] Yes, I find that has helped me a bit also because I have quite a short attention span . Also, I am currently on the path of trying to find more unique techniques to help revision more fun and exciting for me",[supporter] That's great! you will do awesome.,,1216,Normal,Pressures from my parent to be the top of the class,The expectations also affect my friendships. I feel like I cannot connect with anyone because I am focused on pleasing them,"I hear how the pressure is squeezing out your social life and support. When you feel pulled between grades and friends, what do you fear will happen if you choose connection, like falling behind or being judged?",I have not told my friends. I worry they will not understand,"That worry is understandable. Many people carry similar pressure quietly, so sharing a small piece might actually deepen trust.

I keep worrying about all the expense that I'll have to spend and what if I can't afford because of how much I earn,[supporter] Is it possible for you to talk to your parents about this? It seems to me that they  are at the root of your problems,"[seeker] I don't really want to talk to them, I'm not very close to them and rarely tell them my problems","[supporter] Well, if you are not close to them does their opinion really count for so much?",[seeker] it still affects me nonetheless,[supporter] I do understand how hard it can be to shake off your family's preconceptions and expectations even though you are not close to them,,,,,,447,Normal,I realize my career will not pay much and I feel bad for choosing it,My family expectations weigh on my decisions,"That tension is real: stability versus meaning. When you picture a satisfying future, what matters more to you right now, income, impact, lifestyle, or growth?",I often choose paths that make them proud but it does not align with what I want,"It makes sense you feel torn.

I work in cruise industry and it has been a tough few months,I have been thinking about reaching out to friends in the cruise industry for insights,"That is a smart step, and it can also reduce uncertainty when you hear what others are seeing. What information would help you most right now, how stable your company is, what roles are hiring, or how to pivot if needed?",Staying in touch might give me a sense of what is happening in the industry,"That makes a lot of sense. You could ask a few targeted questions, like whether they are seeing hiring freezes, which departments are safer, and what skills are in demand.

What part of the meeting worries you most, being judged, conflict, not having answers, or something else?",I might schedule breaks and practice mindfulness before the meeting,"Mindfulness and breaks can help your body settle.

I don't know how to not let their opinions not bother me,[supporter] Have you ever tried affirmations or heard of this before?,[seeker] No. What is that?,[supporter] Affirmations are positive statements you think about yourself. What I like to do when I'm feeling really anxious is say three positive things/attributes I feel about myself over and over again until my anxiety dissipates. Do you think that could help you feel more positively about what those closest to you are saying so much with regards to looks?,[seeker] I could try. Do I need to say positive things about my looks or can they be about other stuff?,"[supporter] Since you are stating that you are concerned about how you look, you should just find a few positive statements with regards to your looks you think about yourself and repeat them. So if you don't think you need to lose weight, you can say something like, ""I like my weight."" or ""I don't need to lose weight."" If you think you are beautiful or pretty, you can say ""I am beautiful."" My three affirmations I use for myself are: I am beautiful, smart, and funny. I say this over and over again until my anxiety has left me.",,,1031,Normal,I always feel like the way I look does not live up to the expectations of those close to me. This makes me very anxious when I go to meet with them.,"Also, I've noticed that sometimes when I try to affirm myself, I still feel the old doubts creeping back in.","It’s completely normal to have lingering doubts, especially when they’ve been part of your thoughts for a long time. Can you share what specific doubts come to mind when you’re trying to affirm yourself?","I often think about what my friends said before, like how they compare me to others and say I should dress differently.","That sounds painful, especially when those comments come from people close to you. When those thoughts show up, it can help to separate “their preference” from “my worth.” What do *you* like about your appearance or style, even one small thing, and what would make meeting them feel a little safer for you?",TRUE
[supporter] I am so sorry to hear that you want to tell me what happened?,"[seeker] Yeah, apparently the covid situation was getting to him and after he lost his job, he decided he wanted to find himself and try the single life after ten years together","[supporter] oh no that is terrible, are you able to support yourself financially without him?","[seeker] Yeah, thankfully, I was basically supporting us both. It was just the shock of it all. I came home from work and he was packing his things, no discussion, nothing just it's over and I've literally been crying all day. I don;t even think I miss him, I'm just mad about how he went about it","[supporter] That is cruel, I am sure you are in shock, to leave without an explanation, or a real one is terrible. So you have no contact withim what so ever?","[seeker] No contact, I sort of lost my temper when he tried to talk things over because I think he was going to use this as a threat but I was so disgusted after being tired from work that I just threw my phone and now my way of contacting him is gone","[supporter] Maybe that is not all bad, gives him time to think and you too. And if he regrets what he did he will return. But then you would have to make a decission, if you would want him back.","[seeker] I sort of don't think I want him back. Not when he thinks our relationship is some sort of pawn for him to hold over my head. It sucks because my parents didn't even like him, I stuck my neck out for him and now this happens","[supporter] Well I am sure it sucks and feels a bit lonely. But if you dont want him back have a glass of wine and celebrate the you, you deserve the best and nothing less.","[seeker] I think I'm more scared of being alone because we were together for so long, you know? Like I haven't ever lived on my own. It sounds dumb but I think I'm going to miss the company more than my relationship","[supporter] I believe it is hard to home is all of a sudden much more quiet, maybe invite a friend over? I am sorry you are going through this.","[seeker] Or I could get a cat, to be honest being a cat lady might be less stressful",[seeker] A cat would definitely be cheaper,"[supporter] They are fun to have LOL, now that is the spirit go to the shelter and safe one of those poor souls. And you can pet it and it is happy to see you any time,",,,,,,,714,Normal,I just broke up with my boyfriend and I hinestly don't know what to do,"Also, I've been thinking about how I want to focus on myself a bit more. I want to take this time to figure out what makes me happy.",That sounds like a great idea. Focusing on yourself can be really empowering. What are some things you’ve always wanted to try or do for yourself?,"I’ve always wanted to take up painting again. I used to love it in high school, but I stopped once life got busy. It could be a good outlet.","Painting sounds like a gentle, expressive way to take care of yourself right now. If starting feels hard, you could make it very small—one sketch, one color, 15 minutes—just to reconnect with it. What kind of painting did you enjoy most back then, and what would make it fun to begin again?",TRUE
[supporter] what is the problem you are facing,[seeker] The problem that I am facing is that my professor would not listen to my case about my grade,[seeker] It felt very bad because I was silenced and could not do anything,[supporter] so you are saying that your grade is low and your professor is not listening to you,[seeker] yeah pretty much,[seeker] he would not respond to my emails and when i got the dean involved he disregarded the whole situation,"[supporter] that's terrible, have you go through a lecturer that you are at least close to","[seeker] Nope, I ended up learning from the situation and accepting that there are thing I just cannot change","[supporter] i had an issue like that with my supervisor. He wouldn't schedule a meeting or reply my mail, not until i went to a lecturer they all know","[supporter] i can feel your stress, just take it easy with your self",[seeker] Yes you're right,[seeker] I think i have to accept that it's okay to go to the higher ups because thats what they are there for,"[supporter] yes, should mail or call him, leave a voice note if need be, tell him that you will take it up if he didn't respond to you",[seeker] I agree I will do it after the holidays are over because right now everything is closed,[seeker] the outcome will not matter because whatever comes from it I will know that I tried everything I could,"[supporter] yes, it is holiday season. Have a nice holiday first and face the issue head on after",[seeker] I agree thank you for the help your messages gave me reassurance that I am not in the wrong,"[supporter] once everyone sees that you have been trying to get in touch with him but he refuse to respond, then your case is already favored",,,79,Normal,"I got a B+ in a class that I deserved an A- in and when I contacted the professor, he called me a liar. This really put me in a bad mood because I tried really hard in his class and he would not hear my case out.","Also, I've been thinking about how I might present my case more clearly when I do reach out to the dean.",That sounds like a constructive approach. How do you plan to outline your situation to make it clear for the dean?,I think I will gather all my emails and any assignments I submitted to show my efforts.,"That preparation sounds solid. It may also help to write a short, factual timeline (what you submitted, when, what the grading policy says) and clearly state what you’re requesting (a review, clarification, or regrade). What is the most specific outcome you want the dean to consider?",TRUE

Is that about right?,[seeker] yes,[supporter] I understand that... Did something happen that makes you feel like that?,[seeker] yes their is no communication or interaction between me and them nobody answers phone calls txt messages etc,[supporter] Is this a significant other?,[seeker] no friends,[supporter] Are they ignoring you?,[seeker] when we where younger we all hung out all the time now that we are older its like they talk with each other im not sure if i did anything or not,[supporter] Are you sure they are okay? Or not away with family for the holidays?,[seeker] it doesnt matter they still keep open communication with each other,[supporter] That's no good what do you think the problem is?,[seeker] I believe its because I am the friend that has financial trouble and normally needs to borrow money,[supporter] Do you owe someone already?,,,,,1,Normal,I have complete unsupportive friends its to the point where i dont even feel like i have friends any more .,"Also, I feel like they might be judging me because of my financial situation.",It sounds tough to feel like your friends are making assumptions about you. Have you had a chance to talk to them about how you feel?,Not really. I'm worried that it might just make things worse or make them uncomfortable.,"That fear is understandable, especially if you’re not sure they’ll respond kindly. If you wanted to test the waters, you could start with one person you trust most and share a small piece of how you’ve been feeling, rather than everything at once. Who in your circle—if anyone—has shown even a little empathy in the past?",TRUE
"[supporter] Hi, How are you doing today?",[seeker] a bit concerned as I am afraid that my job will let go more staff like they did a couple months ago,[supporter] Ah im sorry to hear that. Best advice i can give is to play for exactly that.,[seeker] I am afraid id they let more people go I may be let go as well.,"[supporter] Like maybe get your resume cleaned up, cast some lines out for employment now, checked linkdin, worst come to worst, make sure you know how to fill out unemployment for the future.",[supporter] If you have a plan already it will ease some of that anxiety that will come from this tough situation,"[seeker] At my age,  i fo not want to look for another job,  i prefer to stay at this job until I retire.  So that makes me anxious","[supporter] Unfortunately, life doesnt always do what we want. What we can do is plan ahead though. It will make you less anxious if you know you have a back up plan.",[seeker] I hate the thought that i may have to start over,[supporter] I know that is a really rough thing to go through. Do you have anyone at home you can talk to as well? Just letting it out helps sometimes.,"[seeker] No,  I do not,  but I can call a friend","[supporter] It might make you feel a bit better, maybe they can give you some perspective as well.",,,,,,,,,571,Normal,My job terminated a lot of people recently and I am afraid that they will do that again and I may lose my job if that happens,"Also, I keep thinking about how many people were let go. It makes me feel even more anxious about my own position.","It's understandable to feel that way, especially when witnessing others being affected. Have you noticed any changes in your workplace that might give you more insight?","I've seen some shifts in management and a lot of stress among my colleagues. That worries me, too.","That would worry most people—your anxiety is a normal response to instability. It might help to focus on what you can control: staying informed, keeping connections strong, and quietly updating a resume or skills.

"[seeker] Hello, how are you?","[supporter] Im am fine, How's things today?","[seeker] Stressful, but I have to deal with it. I can't afford to not be present.",[supporter] I understand that many people now in these days are in a position where he or she needs to be at a location and that is stressfull,[seeker] So i guess the point of this is for me to talk about what it is that I'm facing?,"[seeker] I have to have a brave face for everyone because I'm in charge of young people. I have to be strong for them, but it leaves me feeling exhausted",[supporter] Being a father of two girls makes my skin cringe. Young people can be very challenging. Tell me more about this?,"[seeker] I teach special needs students, and they definitely make me happy. It's a very, very rewarding job. However, with political division and COVID, it's hard to reach this population. Parents are not supportive. I feel like I'm being stretched so thin.","[seeker] I'm also a parent, and my son is doing virtual learning, so he's just as isolated.",[supporter] I remember a time where learning crisis management that taking a deep breath and meditating in the positive work that you are doing can open up your mind to suggestions from your inner self. Have you ever thought that you superb skills can transmit in your home as well?,"[seeker] Getting to that mindsight is challenging when the overwhelming feelings of 'failure' loom so heavily. I was seeing a therapist and making great strides, then he informed me that he was moving to a private practice. I cannot afford his sliding scale, and I feel let down. It's just that when one thing starts to go wrong, other things follow. Most of the time I see myself as a positive person that can work through challenging situations, but like you said it's a tough time for everyone","[supporter] So now that you understand that you have a awesome skill and that is being positive, build on this. What building blocks can you write down that has helped you pushed through the fire and keep it some where close to you to always give you piece of mind and reinforce your habits of pushing through the fire.","[seeker] Well, I am not one for journaling or anything. I try to stay active. I am about 6 months into remission from stage 4 HL (cancer) and it's been quite the emotional journey there. With that said, the mental and physical overhaul left quite a dent in my overall feelings about myself. I'm just now able to run again and in the past week I ran 2 5k's. To me, this was monumental and made me feel great. I'm also learning how to not overextend myself. I just keep hoping for continued improvement in all areas. The reinforcement is just that I can get through this, these feelings are only temporary.","[supporter] I totally understand that you are not for writing things down to keep. Yet, you have gone through a alot of events in your life where other would have given up. The key is transmitting your successes regardless of the situations. COVID is not going anywhere and as a person who has beaten stage 4 cancer, it is scary to be living in these times. You are doing monumental things, never forget that because your feelings and stamina for living will bind everything together. Politics, is the dirtiest and no government can solve  and will solve the problems in the world.",[seeker] thank you for listening. It helps to sometimes just get it out there.

It feels different from being in person with the kids.",That makes sense. It's tough to create the same connection online as in-person. How are you managing that shift?,"I'm trying interactive activities, but I sometimes lose their attention. I'm worried about their progress.","With everything you’re carrying, it makes sense you’d worry—and the fact that you’re showing up consistently already matters to them. Online, attention can come in shorter bursts, so it may help to plan quick “switch-ups” every few minutes and include one moment where kids respond actively. What kinds of activities have held their attention the best so far?",TRUE
[supporter] I agree. It's like there is no more hope. But do you know something?,[supporter] It is ok to feel sad sometimes.,[supporter] You're the stronger one in this position.

I had my whole life planned out and it was going to end in a long term marriage and now its all gone.",[seeker] I was thinking of getting a pet or something but I don't know if I am worthy.,"[supporter] This way sound weird, but I tell myself if something is not meant to happen, it would not. If you want to look at a more positive side of this, you can say this was a good thing that happened.",[seeker] I have always wanted a cat or a dog but my boyfriend said I wouldn't be good at raising anything.

Trust me.,[seeker] I appreciate the support and need to hear positive words. Do you think I need to take a vacation or something?,"[supporter] It is hard to get passed someone's words, especially after spending so much time with them. How about start with a fish. I have a betta and he is really easy to take care of. But I have the responsibility of attending to his needs. If you can take care of a fish, you surely can take care of a cat or dog!",[supporter] I apologize if my typing is slow,[supporter] I think maybe a small vacation would help. Or doing something you really enjoy. Is there anything you can think of?,[seeker] I really love that idea and I love fish! I have always wanted an aquarium. I am thankful for your thoughtfulness and not just telling me what I want to hear.,[seeker] I like to go boating but its hard to do alone. I also like to go hiking but its dangerous to go alone.,"[supporter] I agree. Are you a social person by any chance? By saying that I mean you can still go do those activities, but you can maybe meet people there and ask if you can join their group. That's great in a way because you meet new people and there are no attachments after you leave. It's like a fun, crazy experience :)",[seeker] Thank you for the support that is a good idea because I do like going bowling and I heard about a open social bowling night.,"[supporter] Oh that's awesome!

I really miss the companionship, and it's a bit lonely right now.","Loneliness after a long relationship is so real—your whole daily rhythm changed.

Letting yourself feel the emotions is an important part of getting through a difficult situation.",[seeker] But I want to keep his photos. And how would I even distract myself that much that I'd stop thinking about him completely.,"[supporter] It is understandable to want to keep photos. Distracting yourself might not be the solution; that could stop you from processing the emotions. There is a stage of grieving for a lost relationship that happens when a relationship ends. There will be grieving for the person, and for the relationship with that person. That is what has to be processed in order to move on.","[seeker] Ok, I mean , I can try, But it's just, I don't want to leave him behind. I miss him","[supporter] That makes sense; you care about him so you miss him. This is one of those things that will take time.
